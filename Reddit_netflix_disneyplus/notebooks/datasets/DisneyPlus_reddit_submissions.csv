"Your thoughts on ""Strange World"" (2022)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b54u98yoq6nb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec81ccf094af3c4392ca0deab879b2b6ae88a1a2

**Overview**

*Strange World* is an adventure story that draws inspiration from old sci fi stories in pulp magazines, and movies like *Journey to the Center of the Earth* and *Fantastic Voyage*. It was a huge bomb at the box office (performing worse than Pixar's *Lightyear*), but I don't think Disney ever believed in it or cared about it, and their almost nonexistent advertising for the film bears that out. Affected by a number of factors (such as the public willingness to wait for animated movies to stream on Disney+, and the controversial presence of the studio's first openly LGBT character), Disney seemingly sent *Strange World* out to die and put all their focus into bigger contemporary films like *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* and *Avatar: The Way of Water*.

**Point by Point**

* *Strange World* opens with celebrated explorer Jaeger Clade and his tag-along son Searcher attempting to breach the mountains that surround their insular country of Avalonia, as no one has ever ventured past them. After a good-looking set piece in a collapsing ice cave, Searcher discovers a plant growing nearby that generates electricity (which Avalonia has not yet discovered and harnessed). Searcher wants to take the plant back to the people of Avalonia, but Jaeger stubbornly insists on continuing the expedition past the mountains, so the two end up going their separate ways.
* Twenty-five years later, Searcher and his family (wife Meridian and son Ethan) are farmers, providing Avalonia with crops of the electric plant (now called Pando) it needs in order to power society. Just as Searcher rejected his father's expectations for him years ago, however, his own son Ethan isn't so sure he wants to inherit the farm. The town is pretty and well lit, and the overall aesthetic really puts me in mind of Columbia in *Bioshock Infinite*.
* For reasons unknown, Pando crops all over are dying, so Searcher joins an expedition to find out why, and what can be done to save it. Pando is actually a singular organism deep underground, putting out tendrils all over the surface, and the expedition intends to travel to the “heart of Pando”. Predictably, Searcher's adventurous son stows away, and Mom follows both of them. There's also a three-legged dog named Legend who ends up getting into all sorts of endearing mischief.
* The world beneath the surface looks really good, and is populated with weird flora and fauna. Before long they discover Jaeger, who's been trapped down here all this time. This provides some opportunities for family drama and heart-to-heart chats, none of which is very interesting. There are some good action set pieces, however, including fights with the local creatures and a voyage across an acidic sea.
* Ultimately, the characters find out that their world is actually an immense, turtle-like creature, and that they've been traveling through its insides this whole time! Not only that, Pando is an infection that's killing the creature and must be destroyed! (A bit on the nose, I think. Avalonia's source of power is killing their world and they have to give it up? Okay, Disney, you first, but good luck running your amusement parks on just wind and solar.)

**In Conclusion**

*Strange World* is strikingly reminiscent of *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. It's a low-key adventure story with gradual pacing, character development, and slightly more grown-up themes. I can't see young children being very captivated by it. Like *Atlantis*, I think it will be re-evaluated in due time. For now, I rank it Okay.

"Confused on my bundle, about the planned price increase, and the options to change bundles.","**SOLVED:**

Sorry for the lengthy post but I'm scratching my head on this.

&#x200B;

I signed up for the Disney+ bundle when it first started. Wanting Hulu no ads, I upgraded my Hulu plan to the ad-free plan. Never touched my accounts since then...

When I look at my Disney+ account, it shows I have the ""Legacy Disney Bundle"" for $15/month.

So right now, I'm getting charged $15/month when I check my Hulu account and $7/month when I check my Disney+ account. So total $22/month. So yeah I've been paying $2/month total more now than the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

Got the email from saying  ""The price of Disney Bundle Trio Basic will increase on October 12, 2023 to $14.99/month. The price change will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 12."" But I don't have that bundle.

...

When the increase happens, my Hulu plan will increase to $18/month (says when I check on my account page)...not sure what my Disney+ will charge me. If it's still $7/month, I'm fine with that since that equals the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

But if Disney+ will charge more then I want to change my bundle. BUT...i don't see any. Disney+ only shows option for Disney+ (basic for premium) and Hulu only shows option for Hulu (Hulu or Hulu (no-ads)).

"Your thoughts on ""Encanto"" (2021)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Released during the reign of COVID, *Encanto* enjoyed just thirty days of theatrical exclusivity before being released (at no premium) on Disney+. It found an audience on the streaming platform, however, and became widely successful and acclaimed, due in no small part to its hit soundtrack. It may not have been met with as much prestige and fanfare as *Frozen* or *Moana*, but I'd say its place among the Disney animated musicals of its era is assured.

**Point by Point**

* As usual, the visuals are amazing and colorful throughout. The opening song, 'The Family Madrigal', is a good way of introducing the various members of the clan and their special abilities. I did have to turn on subtitles in order to understand the lyrics, however.
* Grandma Alma has been through a lot. When her children were just babies, she and her husband had to flee some unspecified coup or revolution, and her husband was killed. The miracle occurred then, and created a safe place for the fleeing peasants to live. She's been holding tightly onto that ever since, afraid of it slipping away, and she's reached the point where the magic and the gifts have become the point of it all; the family must serve the miracle, rather than the other way around. She runs the family like a corporation, and applies her family's gifts and talents where she believes they'll do the most good for the community. Thus, the super-strong Luisa spends her days fetching runaway donkeys and holding up collapsing buildings, and Isabela – seen as the “golden child” - is pressured into an arranged marriage for the sake of more offspring with more miraculous powers. Meanwhile, Bruno, Alma's own son, ultimately chooses exile because his power to see the future is unpredictable and problematic.
* As the movie begins with young Antonio about to receive his gift (which turns out to be the ability to communicate with animals), we get a good look at how it all works. Each member of the family receives a huge, magical room (extradimensional in nature, as each room appears bigger than the entire house) that reflects their special gift. Mirabel, of course, never got one, and it's easy to relate to her. She overcompensates in her daily life, trying so hard to serve the family in any way she can, while feeling like she's less special than everyone else around her. Her song, 'Waiting on a Miracle', which she performs as everyone gathers around and celebrates Antonio, conveys the appropriate feelings of longing and disappointment. I really did feel sorry for her here.
* Luisa and Isabela both have great character development songs, with 'Surface Pressure' and 'What Else Can I Do?' respectively. I'm not sure why 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' was such a hit. It's just okay, it's no 'Let It Go'. Bruno is an interesting character, though, and likable; quirky, in a Jeff Goldblum sort of way. It's sad that he's been living in the walls for about a decade and no one has noticed.
* Mirabel's reconciliation with Alma at the river is a good moment. All along it's seemed as though Alma has regarded Mirabel as an emblem of failure and bad fortune, even if she didn't mean to, so it's nice to hear her give Mirabel some validation. She realizes now that she's been missing the point lately, and has been sacrificing the family to feed the miracle, but Mirabel reassures her in turn, pointing out that the miracle happened *because* of Alma.

**In Conclusion**

*Encanto* is fun, colorful, and dramatic, with good characters and good songs, and it handles the subject of a large, quirky family a lot more capably than *Meet the Robinsons* does. I don't quite rank it an S, but there's no question it belongs among the Greats.

"Your thoughts on ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" (2021)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vswzlvfkf7mb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=844ad47d2ae527b5029034f25962a0e923786876

**Overview**

A fantasy adventure inspired by a Southeast Asian aesthetic, *Raya and the Last Dragon* was the first WDAS film to be produced during the reign of COVID. As such, it was released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ (albeit at a $30 premium). Because of these circumstances beyond its control, and despite good reviews, *Raya* became one of the lowest-grossing WDAS movies of the past twenty years, with only *Treasure Planet* and *Winnie the Pooh* having grossed less during that time.

**Point by Point**

* As we've come to expect, *Raya and the Last Dragon* is a great-looking movie; WDAS rarely disappoints when it comes to visuals. The world in which it takes place boasts a diverse array of landscapes, all of which are rendered appealingly, and the animation is wonderfully fluid. I like the design of Sisu; she has some typical characteristics of an Asian dragon, but is covered with fur instead of scales, and her face is more mammalian than reptilian. The filmmakers did a good job crafting a look that sets Sisu apart from other cinematic dragons and makes her compelling to look at.
* Okay, so, the land is divided into five fiercely competitive tribes, with one of those tribes guarding a mystical “dragon gem” responsible for holding at bay an ancient evil called the Druun. The gem is coveted by the other tribes, and, during a diplomatic summit, an attempt to steal it results in its breaking into five pieces. This, in turn, results in the immediate resurgence of the Druun, whose main thing is turning everybody to stone. Each tribe seizes a piece of the broken gem and flees. Six years later, Raya is traveling the hostile land, searching for Sisu, whom she finally succeeds, inadvertently, in summoning. Together, they decide to reunite the fragments of the dragon gem. Princess Namaari of the Fang tribe – who tried six years ago to steal the gem and ultimately caused this epic disaster – remains an antagonist, and dogs their steps, hoping to acquire the fragments for Fang.
* The story has potential, but the cast of characters isn't particularly strong. Raya and her traveling companions – a boy who cooks, a fiendishly intelligent baby, and a brute with a heart of gold who seems like he stepped out of the tavern scene in *Tangled* – aren't very interesting or developed. We don't really learn anything about them or what makes them tick; just that they're sad about their loved ones having been turned to stone. Namaari, in particular, is desperately hard to sympathize with, because we've seen firsthand how she basically caused all this, and *still* she's the hardass of the story, working at the behest of her power-hungry, short-sighted mother. Sisu is fun and funny, and steals every scene that she's in.
* The main problem with *Raya*, even more than the bland characters and underserved premise, is the moral the filmmakers try to push. The story ultimately ends up being about trust, and how you have to see the good in people. The trouble is, the movie doesn't earn that moral at all. The whole fiasco happened because Raya and her father trusted people to not be terrible. Raya's father tried to get everyone together for the common good, but no, these degenerates decided they'd rather just fight and kill each other forever. Then, all throughout the adventure, Sisu tries to instill in Raya the importance of trust, but, when Raya decides to actually take Sisu's advice and trust Namaari to do the right thing for once in her miserable life, what happens? Surprise, surprise, Namaari is her usual, terrible self, and Sisu ends up dead; humanity's last hope, shot through the chest and knocked off a cliff.
* And then Namaari (and, by extension, the filmmakers) has the nerve to gaslight Raya into thinking that she bears equal responsibility for Sisu's death. Sorry, but no. No, no, and emphatically hell no. Namaari was the one who betrayed Raya's trust, then whipped out a crossbow, pointed it at Sisu, and curled her finger around the trigger. The tragedy is one hundred percent on Namaari's shoulders, and if Raya had killed Namaari in their duel afterwards, then it would have been justice served, albeit six years late.
* So, Namaari finally putting the fragments together by herself and banishing the Druun is supposed to be some sort of vindication of trust? Easy for her to finally do the right thing when it's literally her only option. The fact is, Raya was absolutely right not to trust Namaari, and was *proven* right. Yet the message the filmmakers seem to be trying to impart here is that you should feel obligated to keep giving toxic people the opportunity to stab you in the back until they finally decide it's in their best interest not to.

**In Conclusion**

I would have placed *Raya and the Last Dragon* among the Okays – its bland characters and lack of musical numbers rule it out from placing any higher – but the attempted moral message is so infuriating and delivered so badly that it makes me outright dislike the project as a whole. So, down to the bottom it goes, I'm afraid.

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen II"" (2019)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8bjxoookllb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cf7ad8a4498d86a263c0c4bb7c924d41d2ea652

**Overview**

As phenomenally successful as *Frozen* was, a sequel was all but inevitable, and the talent behind the original movie returned to continue the story. *Frozen II* sees Elsa struggling with her destiny, being pulled in opposite directions between her role as queen of Arendelle and the allure of some enigmatic spiritual force. Meanwhile, Kristoff is making plans to propose to Anna, and Olaf has a new “permafrost” (the personal flurry Elsa gave him at the end of *Frozen* proved difficult to animate).

**Point by Point**

* *Frozen II* looks great, there's no denying that. The autumnal scenery (particularly within the Enchanted Forest) is gorgeous. I'm glad they went with autumn as a design choice. We've already seen plenty of lush, green forests in summertime, and, for the world of Frozen, the crisp, windswept days of fall strike a more natural note. There are so many excellent set pieces; the bleak desolation of the area surrounding the shipwreck; the scene with Elsa charging determinedly at the sea and wrestling with the water spirit; and the destruction of the dam by the earth giants, resulting in the huge tidal wave coursing towards Arendelle.
* The music, however, doesn't live up to that of its predecessor. I found most of the songs to be pretty drab. 'Into the Unknown' and 'Show Yourself' are the only standouts, in my opinion, and neither of them approaches the greatness of 'Let It Go'. Having said that, the 'Show Yourself' sequence is very impressive. The emotion on Elsa's face when she sees her mother is wonderfully captured, and so lifelike.
* I find the story of *Frozen II* mostly uninteresting, and it tends to drag. I do appreciate what the filmmakers do with Elsa's personal journey, however. Although it's not stated bluntly, it's pretty obvious that Elsa, at the beginning of the movie, is feeling unfulfilled with her life on the throne of a small kingdom. The insular world of Arendelle isn't enough for her, even if she doesn't know it yet. When she hears some far off voice calling her, she throws herself into the quest immediately, and, when she's forced to use her powers to overcome the angry spirits that greet her and her traveling companions, you can tell she's absolutely loving it. The scene where she's on her own, fighting the ocean and wrestling for her life against that water horse thing? That's all she's ever wanted. In the end, she makes Anna the queen of Arendelle, and stays out there. She's too big for Arendelle; too wild. Now she's free.

**In Conclusion**

*Frozen II* is beautiful to look at, has a couple of great songs, and gives Elsa a satisfying arc. Those things are what carry the movie for me. The whole package is definitely less than the sum of its parts. Instead of watching the entire movie again, I'm more likely to just watch 'Show Yourself' on YouTube.

"Your thoughts on ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" (2018)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/becpcu3vi7lb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b0f88c96936900051a1c51aecc76236e6d06c9

**Overview**

WDAS movies don't often receive sequels. At this point in time, *The Rescuers* had been the only one to do so. The makers of *Wreck-It Ralph* evidently believed they had more to say, however, so, in this latest adventure, Ralph and Vanellope have to use the arcade's new Wi-Fi router to enter the Internet and find a replacement part for Vanellope's *Sugar Rush* game before it's scrapped. This gives the filmmakers the opportunity to comment on Internet culture and phenomena, in much the same way the original film explored the nuances of video gaming.

**Point by Point**

* The film starts off kind of slow, although we do get to enjoy some more cameos from video game celebrities like Chun Li and Sonic the Hedgehog. From the outset we're given a glimpse at the conflicts that will define the story; Vanellope is feeling bored and unfulfilled, and Ralph is displaying unhealthy attachment to her. Things pick up a bit when they finally make it onto the Internet. The film's concept of the cyber world is a vast city, with Amazon, Snapchat, and Google embodied by mighty skyscrapers, and Internet users represented by cute little avatars. When they find out they need actual money in order to acquire a *Sugar Rush* steering wheel, they initially get into loot hunting, and are tasked with stealing a high-value racing vehicle from a semi-apocalyptic MMO called *Slaughter Race*. The owner of the car, Shank, isn't having it, but she does teach Ralph and Vanellope how to go viral for bucks instead.
* While Ralph is busy making an ass of himself for likes, Vanellope ends up on a Disney website for fans. 'Let It Go' rings through the air, and characters like Buzz Lightyear, Baymax, Iron Man, and Eeyore mill about. Then, of course, there's the Disney princess segment. I guess some people like it, but...I don't. I think it's really, really cringe. Like, embarrassingly so. I was embarrassed while watching it. (The scene at the end of the film, when they all join together to help rescue Ralph, is a bit better.)
* The story never really gets interesting, and is predictable throughout. Gee, I wonder if Vanellope is going to decide to stay in *Slaughter Race*. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to regret unleashing that clearly dangerous virus. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to learn a lesson about respecting boundaries. Even the climax is kind of blah, because it's just Ralph facing his own insecurities; there's no actual antagonist.
* And the movie ends with Vanellope going Turbo. She goes Turbo and leaves *Sugar Rush* for *Slaughter Race*. The whole point of *Wreck-It Ralph* is that you don't go Turbo; it causes nothing but trouble. Don't tell me the players won't notice Vanellope is missing from the *Sugar Rush* line-up; at the beginning of the movie, we see a player excitedly pick Vanellope because “she has the best super power”. Going by what we saw in the original *Wreck-It Ralph*, *Sugar Rush* shouldn't be long for this world with the princess of Candy Land or whatever permanently dropped out. But no, never mind the message we sold you in the first movie. Going Turbo is fine.
* All in all, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* doesn't feel like sufficient justification for bringing these characters back in a new movie. The premise isn't very interesting, and the examination of Internet tropes, while amusing for a while, ultimately wears thin. All of the emphasis on memes and Internet-based companies seems kind of crass and soulless; like it won't stand the test of time. The Disney segment, in particular, feels more like blatant self-promotion than cute fan service. And then, of course, there's the complete invalidation of the message of the original movie.

**In Conclusion**

Lacking in heart and substance, and heavy with self-promotion and commercialism, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* feels more akin to an animated movie one would expect from DreamWorks or Illumination, not WDAS. It's definitely one of their weakest films, down there with *The Black Cauldron* and *Chicken Little*.

I'm worried about the upcoming Percy Jackson series.,"Percy Jackson is a book series that means the world to me. I fell in love with it in High School and I've never really stopped being obsessed with it. It's in my Top 5 favorite Franchises.

So when it was announced it was getting an adaptation second chance in 2020 I was hyped. It was the thing that kept me going that year.

So now the trailer is out. We have a release date. Two days from my birthday in fact.

And a lot of that excitement is still there but there's also a fair amount of worry.

And no this has nothing to do with the fact Annabeth is black or Percy has red hair. Whatever. I don't care about that.

It's that...so much has happened in between the announcement and now.

Before Disney overdosed on Disney Plus content and started burning people out.

Before the writer's and actors guild strikes

Before the infamous Disney Plus purge that led to a lot of stuff getting removed.

Before Disney said they were gonna cut back on streaming.

Just..before a lot of stuff.

There's also something I've noticed. Content on Disney Plus that isn't connected to Marvel, Pixar, or Star Wars tends to have a Shelf life. Two seasons and that's it. And if you're lucky you get to stay on the platform.

Percy Jackson is in a unique place because it's based on a pre-existing property with a huge and devoted fanbase. But books aren't exactly ""Mainstream"".

I can't escape the feeling that this is...the precipice of change. The turning point for Disney Plus.

If it does well it could be the shot in the arm Disney needs. Something to get the masses tuning in for Disney Plus because, unlike Marvel and Star Wars, this show won't require you to know about the backstory in order to fully understand it.

But if it doesn't do well it could be just another forgotten Disney Plus show. A causality of Disney spread Disney Plus too far too fast. (I saw someone comment somewhere that they think if Percy Jackson hadn't finished filming there's a decent chance they would have scrapped it and I'm inclined to agree sadly)

And I don't want that for Percy Jackson. I don't even care if they don't do all the sequels and spin-offs. I just want them to at least finish the first book series.

I just gotta hope.

TLDR: I'm worried about the upcoming Percy Jackson show because Disney is not in the same place as it was when the show was first announced.

Sorry if I rambled too long or if I was too much of a negative Nancy. I've just had these feelings building up for a while and I wanted to get them out of my system.

Kicked Off Disney Legacy Bundle Plan,"I go to log in today to Disney+, and it doesn't work on any device.  Same with ESPN+, so it looks like there's a problem with the bundle.  When I go to my computer to log in, it takes me to a screen where it says to 'complete my subscription', but there's no button, so it's functionally a dead-end.  Can't even get into account settings.  

I chat with customer service where they say my account was cancelled and, sure enough, I look and my CC wasn't billed this month.  Thing is, I'm the only one with access, and I didn't cancel anything.  They inform me that my only option at this point is to sign up for another plan, effectively raising my price.  The legacy plan is only about $90/year.  The closest thing to that plan is either the Trio basic (154/year) or the trio premium (240/year!)  

I strongly suspect Disney did this as a way to force me onto a new plan.  It's a legacy plan that they don't like, so they'd prefer if people migrated to more expensive plans, and they are saying I cancelled as an excuse to get me off of it.  Customer service rep is denying it, of course.  I've insisted they give me more details on the cancellation, since I didn't do it, and I'm waiting for a response.  Anybody else seen this?

**Overview**

John Musker and Ron Clements (directors of *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Princess and the Frog*, among others) return to deliver us another beautiful, musical extravaganza, steeped this time in ancient Polynesian culture and mythology.

**Point by Point**

* *Moana* just might be the best-looking WDAS film yet. Everything in it looks amazing, from the vibrant and colorful characters, to the lush vegetation, and especially the water effects. From the beginning of the film to the end, I was consistently aware of the incredible visuals. The music, too, is some of the best in the studio's canon, with songs that are inspiring, powerful, and catchy. The story isn't quite as meaty as that of some of the other great Disney epics, but it's never dull either, and is supplemented by pure, unadulterated spectacle.
* I don't go as greatly into detail on *Moana* as I do with the other Disney films. This is mostly because I have nothing but high praise for every aspect (no low points to speak of), and because *Moana* is so highly acclaimed and still so fresh in memory that anything I have to say would seem extremely obvious and commonplace. I love Moana's indomitable spirit, and she has real chemistry with Maui. Making the ocean an actual character was an inspired move, and the sequence at the beginning, with the ocean interacting with Moana as a toddler, is a great bit. The Realm of Monsters is an awesome set piece, and the encounter with the giant crab is mesmerizing. The initial, failed assault on Te Ka leads to a dramatic “all is lost” moment, where both the ocean and the spirit of Moana's grandmother actually let Moana off the hook, but, in an inspired reaffirmation set to soaring music, she presses on. The final encounter with Te Ka is spectacular, and the twist – in which Te Ka turns out to actually be Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart – is clever.

**In Conclusion**

All in all, I'd say *Moana* is probably the best WDAS film since the 1990s; even better than *Frozen* in many respects. The visuals, the music, the characterization, and the simple yet dramatic story all come together to form one of the studio's highest points. Definitely top tier material.

I just subscribed to the service and I'm loving it. The app could use some work though.,"The app works great, the price is reasonable and the video quality remains high and whenever it has to switch to low it's usually seemless. I've seen others in my region say they had a bad experience with it but I didn't. My only two problem is the geo-blocked content (I really want to watch The Ghost and Molly Mcgee S2. This isn't the only example but it's the one that bothers me the most) but I get the new Futurama and the recent MCU movies so it's not that bad. My other problem is the app navigation. I doubt the categories on the series and the movies tab show everything because I can reach the last one in them in no time and I don't see somethings that I know are on it and I've watched listed there, which makes the library seem limited, and they don't have an animations category (just adult animation).

"Your thoughts on ""Zootopia"" (2016)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ie7hmx3t4fkb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b935799d5cb67944b046b2780f5c79d6cbdd2d68

**Overview**

Disney's movie history is replete with stories of talking animals, but those talking animals are still living in the world of man. *Zootopia* embraces the concept of animals living in a world that's completely their own, made by them and for them. Disney's own *Robin Hood* would serve as inspiration. In *Robin Hood*, however, the characters don't actually behave like animals, or even really acknowledge that they *are* animals. Every character in *Robin Hood* (with the possible exception of Sir Hiss) could be replaced by a human being and nary a word of dialogue would have to be changed. *Zootopia*, on the other hand, really leans into the concept of a mass population of all sorts of mammals (strangely, there are no birds or reptiles living in Zootopia) trying to get along and function as a society despite their innate differences.

**Point by Point**

* The very first thing we're presented with is the stage play that young Judy Hopps and her friends put on for a talent show, laying out for the audience the dynamics of this society. It's explained, basically, that all animals eventually evolved into humanoids, and the carnivores (or “predators”) made the decision to stop killing the “prey” for food. Surely there must have been some kind of quantum enlightenment along the way, because why would the predators collectively go against their most basic, fundamental instincts and start eating...I dunno, veggie burgers? Protein supplements? Simply electing to let the prey be their equals in this society is an act of incredible benevolence on the predators' part.
* The sprawling city of Zootopia is marvelously and imaginatively conceived. It's not just a generic urban model filled with skyscrapers; it comprises several different habitats and ecosystems, from desert to rain forest to frozen tundra, each catering to the needs of its own population. (This suggests that terraforming and weather manipulation have come a long way indeed in the world of *Zootopia*.) Not only that, but the vast difference in size between animals is accounted for, and gerbils and mice can navigate the city just as easily as giraffes and elephants can.
* Judy Hopps is an extremely likable protagonist; indomitable and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and intolerance. She tries to make the best of being underestimated and assigned to parking patrol, but receives a rude wakeup call when she encounters Nick Wilde, a sly fox who hustles his way through life. Nick is a great character too, and the two of them share a good dynamic. Judy is significantly disenchanted during her second day on the job, but perks up when she has the opportunity to chase a thief through Little Rodentia, in a fast-paced but enjoyable sequence that showcases the juxtaposition between the small and the large. (To the tiny rodents living here, even Judy is like Godzilla.)
* The bit with the nudist animals is fairly clever, precisely because the animals don't look nude to us at all. Judy's cringing with embarrassment and covering her eyes feels completely unwarranted to us. (The area between the spreadeagled legs of the elephant looks unnaturally smooth, however. I'm pretty sure an elephant's genitals would be visible in that position.) The bit with the sloths at the DMV is hilarious, and undoubtedly a highlight of the film. The sequence with Mr. Big is good too, and feels surprisingly fresh, considering how often *The Godfather* has been parodied already.
* Judy putting her foot in her mouth at the press conference shows that even the best of us can be subject to prejudices and bigotries; it's not exclusively the province of mean people. We all have to be introspective. That's a valuable lesson for the kiddies. (It's not a perfect 1:1 comparison, though, because predators really are biologically disposed towards being killing machines. If anything, Nick is denying his biology by *not* eating Judy.)
* The investigation, throughout the film's runtime, is actually pretty basic and procedural, but the colorful, well-realized characters and the imaginative set pieces make it seem otherwise. Though Judy and Nick are doing little more than interviewing witnesses and scrounging for clues, the action is never boring, and it helps that the two play off of each other extremely well. The identity of the villain is a good twist (which seems to be a trend in this era of WDAS movies).

**In Conclusion**

*Zootopia* looks great, and has a lot of great characters and concepts, and delivers a good lesson about the dangers of intolerance and fearmongering. It's a fascinating world that I'd like to see more of. Fortunately, Disney has announced that a sequel is in the works.

"Your thoughts on ""Big Hero 6"" (2014)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9jfe1dke0kb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0c4b71ba0b096cc5d3215d11146db34e9d32ef0

**Overview**

After Disney acquired Marvel in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to comb through Marvel's properties for adaptation prospects, and WDAS landed on *Big Hero 6*, a comparatively obscure comic book series set in Japan. More a reinvention than a proper adaptation (the characters and concepts of the comic book stories are dramatically different), *Big Hero 6* gave WDAS the chance to make its own contribution to the landscape of twenty-first century superhero movies.

**Point by Point**

* *Big Hero 6* takes place in a futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo. The blending of aesthetics makes for an interesting setting, with the hills and streetcars and Victorian-style houses of San Fran blending together with the neon skyscrapers, elevated trains, and cherry blossoms of Tokyo. It doesn't feel like just another generic superhero metropolis, and it's always interesting to look at.
* Hiro is a likable protagonist; a child prodigy who doesn't know how to apply his genius constructively, spending his time on robot fights. His brother Tadashi shows him his college research lab, where we meet Tadashi's friends and fellow students, and Baymax, whose soft, malleable form and consistently even temperament make him the breakout star of the show. His exceedingly gentle nature and genuine concern for his patient's well-being imbue all of his interactions with a warm, safe feeling that you can sense through the screen. (And the bit when he's low on power and acts drunk is hilarious.) It's fitting that Baymax – Tadashi's creation born out of love – is the one to come to Hiro's emotional rescue after Tadashi's untimely death.
* I'm...honestly not sure how we're supposed to respond to Hiro transforming Baymax into a warrior. Obviously, it's not what he was meant for; it's not what Tadashi intended. It seems a bit disrespectful, as though Hiro is missing the point. At the same time, Hiro is really just endowing him with a suit of armor and a knowledge of martial arts for defense; it's not as though he's giving him sword hands or laser eyes. All in all, considering the way the movie ends (with Baymax as a full-fledged superhero), it feels like we're meant to approve of the changes. For all the good that Baymax can doubtless do as a superhero, however, it's hard to ignore the fact that Tadashi's dream for him won't be realized, and that this “personal healthcare companion” has been repurposed as a soldier.
* The confrontation with the masked villain and the chase through the streets is a good action set piece. The way he manipulates the microbots to become thrusting tendrils is viscerally pleasing; kind of like watching Dr. Octopus in action. This sequence also brings Tadashi's friends to the fore, and we get to know them better. Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred are each dynamic and interesting in their own way, and, despite being just support characters, we get enough focus on them so that they don't feel superfluous. The montage (set to Fall Out Boy's 'Immortals', which was written specifically for *Big Hero 6*) of them adapting their tech interests into their superhero personas is a fun and energizing moment.
* Callaghan has an understandable motive for his wrath, but he comes off as pretty two-dimensional. It's like there's nothing to him *except* his wrath. He tries multiple times to kill his own students when they get in his way, and he expresses absolutely zero remorse for causing Tadashi's death. Was he *ever* a good person? Was he *always* this guy? I get the sense that he'd be willing to sacrifice countless innocent lives on the altar of his vengeance. He's presented as merely the one-note bad guy who exists to be overcome. Some greater nuance to his character and his behavior would have been welcome.
* In an intense moment, Hiro gives in to his rage and grief and reprograms Baymax to become a killing machine. In a jarring and abrupt transformation, Baymax's eyes go red and he lunges at Callaghan with a singleminded intent to kill, brushing the others aside like debris as he does so. I don't really have a problem with the morals of it (the idea that ""heroes don't kill"" is extremely simplistic, and counter to thousands of years of storytelling), but it's not what Baymax was made for. In the aftermath, when Hiro is still feeling low and he tries to access Baymax's chip port again, Baymax prevents it and, instead, shows Hiro an archived video of Tadachi. It shows that Baymax does have some agency.
* The climax is suitably exciting and action-packed, and I like Hiro's alternative plan for victory; never mind getting the mask, just smash all the microbots until Callaghan runs out of them. The inside of the portal realm looks good, and Baymax sacrificing himself to get Hiro and Abigail out is the emotional climax. (Fortunately, Baymax doesn't stay gone. That would have made the movie much sadder.)
* Frankly, I don't understand why Callaghan looks so glum when he's being bundled into the back of the police car. For him, the result of all this exceeds his wildest dreams. He got his daughter back. She's alive and well. He came here for revenge, and he was reunited with his daughter instead. He ought to be pleased. Of course, as I observed previously, I don't think Callaghan is characterized very well in general.
* And since *Big Hero 6* is, at its core, a Marvel movie, stick around after the credits for a cameo from Stan Lee!

**In Conclusion**

*Big Hero 6* isn't exactly one of the greats, and it's a bit simplistic, but it's a fun superhero adventure with some nice aesthetics and a touch of that Pixar-esque heart. Solidly good.

I have a bit of regret ever since because now in my iTunes account subscription settings it says I need to pay 109.99 dollars to continue the service.

My subscription ends tomorrow so I decided to bite the bullets hearing that another price hike is coming. So I continue the service in my iTunes subscription page. To my surprise, it now says it will charge me 79.99 dollars tomorrow.

Disney should now release all of the original movies and series they removed from Disney+ on physical media,"Now that Disney is making the remarkable decision to begin releasing its biggest Disney+ original series from Marvel & Star Wars on physical media, I think it is very important that the Disney+ original movies & tv series that were completely removed from the service get physical releases like this as well. 

As of right now there is no legal way to watch upwards of 76 movies & series that were exclusively made for the service. They have effectively removed all of the artists work from the face of the earth! Most of these had 4K releases on Disney+, but if Disney is concerned about spending a lot to release 4K Ultra HD copies of these movies and series, they should at the very least release them on Blu-Ray & DVD.

Will they all sell as well as the Marvel and Star Wars releases? No. But to at least having them AVAILABLE to watch is incredibly important to ensure that these productions are not erased from existence and to preserve them for future generations.

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen"" (2013)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ql4qv1sl7fjb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5405876c9c5ea15bb4966f84509bde11d29e0c02

**Overview**

If there was any doubt remaining – after *The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, and *Wreck-It Ralph* – that WDAS was back at the top of their game, *Frozen* must have obliterated it. With its resonant story, likable characters, and spectacular music, *Frozen* became a worldwide phenomenon, as any parent to a young child at the time would be able to attest. It made over a billion dollars at the box office (it held the record for highest-grossing animated film until 2019's *The Lion King*) and was the first WDAS movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

**Point by Point**

* Opening on the men harvesting the blocks of ice is an interesting choice. It doesn't really have anything to do with the story (aside from introducing us briefly to young Kristoff and Sven), but it gets us thinking about ice. Ice; it's beautiful and dangerous. Beware the frozen heart!
* Young Elsa and Anna are cute kids, and the snow and ice effects are magnificent, as they are throughout the movie. The king and queen mean well, but they fail Elsa badly. Even after the troll chief tells them that fear will be Elsa's enemy, her parents grab onto their fear with both hands and clasp it tight. They don't teach her to control her power, they teach her to hate and fear it. They teach her to hate and fear *herself*. I'm not a parent, so I can't presume to know how I'd react in a situation like this, but, from a detached perspective, the king and queen handle everything incorrectly from the start. (And what's up with those shackles we see Elsa wearing later in her cell? Her parents must have had those made for her and ready to be used. How messed up is that?)
* The story and themes of *Frozen* wouldn't be worth much without a good cast of characters. Of course, the film succeeds in that department as well. Elsa and Anna are both interesting and compelling, and Kristoff and Sven, when they show up, bring a good dynamic to the proceedings. Olaf is not only a brilliant and sympathetic font of comic relief, he's also a perfect demonstrator of Elsa's immense power. Not only has she plunged the entire region into an endless winter, but she's out here creating sentient life without even meaning to!
* *Frozen* is celebrated for its soundtrack, but 'Let It Go', now that's the showstopper; that whole sequence – with the creation of the ice palace and the triumphal change in Elsa's demeanor and appearance – is the highlight of the film right there. There's no doubt it's one of the greatest songs in the WDAS canon.
* After some fun adventures on the way to the ice palace, Anna confronting Elsa in the tower is dramatic and emotional. With Elsa declaring that she has to live a hermit's life, and the dueling singing between she and Anna, and then accidentally blasting Anna in the heart when she once again gives in to her fear and anxiety, it's probably my second-favorite part of the movie (behind the 'Let It Go' sequence).
* The scene with the trolls (and the song 'Fixer Upper') is a good diversion, and does some of the necessary work to get Anna and Kristoff closer to each other. Hans' heel turn might seem to come out of nowhere, although you can definitely pick up on some very subtle hints if you know it's coming. He's a villain, but he's not really *the* villain here. The real antagonist is Elsa's fear and her inability to control her powers; Hans merely takes advantage of all of that. Still, I think his role as would-be usurper is necessary, if only because it gives Anna a chance to sacrifice herself for Elsa, which she does in spectacular fashion.
* The climax on the frozen lake, with the blizzard raging all around, is exciting spectacle, with the best part being when Anna has to make the choice between running towards Kristoff to save herself or running towards Elsa, and chooses Elsa. What follows is perhaps the best subversion of the 'true love's kiss' trope, with Anna's ultimate sacrifice proving to be the act of true love required to break her curse.

**In Conclusion**

With its comparatively complex characters and story, and its magnificent visuals and music, *Frozen* deserves its popularity and prestige. It doesn't quite hit the same heights for me as the best Disney Renaissance movies (and that's probably only because I didn't grow up with it), but, of all the WDAS movies to have rolled out of the studio since *Tarzan*, it definitely comes the closest. My first thought was to file it under Great, but I have to ask myself, am I being nostalgia-biased? If I had been a child when *Frozen* came out, and if I had grown up with it, would I consider it a top tier Disney movie, worthy of standing alongside *The Little Mermaid* and *Beauty and the Beast*? Almost certainly. So, I'm going to make an allowance for my old fogeyness and let *Frozen* have a place at the top, where it most likely belongs.

"Your thoughts on ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (2012)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/naea0ubcktib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dff7b52e818e01b92135bc817816ac022774de8

**Overview**

Using the medium of video games, *Wreck-It Ralph* explores what happens when the assigned villain of a narrative decides he doesn't want to be the villain anymore. Feeling insecure and discontented after thirty years of playing the heavy, Ralph sets out on a quest to change his destiny and gain the respect he craves.

**Point by Point**

* As in *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* and *Toy Story*, the filmmakers here were able to sprinkle in a generous assortment of licensed characters amongst the original cast, and, within the first few minutes, we're treated to cameo appearances by several video game icons. There's Bowser and Dr. Eggman; M. Bison and Zangief; Pac-Man and Q\*Bert and Frogger, among many others. There's no question this background population of recognizable characters makes *Wreck-It Ralph* that much more fun.
* It really is pretty shabby to throw a party for the thirtieth anniversary of *Fix-It Felix Jr.* and not invite Ralph. I mean, I get it, he's a big, clumsy guy, but you could have had the party outside.
* Determined to win a medal and prove he has what it takes to be a hero, Ralph infiltrates a first-person shooter called *Hero's Duty*, and is immediately overwhelmed by how “violent and scary” it is. We become more familiarized with the concept of video game characters as performers as we watch Sergeant Calhoun engage dramatically with the player, represented in-game by a drone equipped with a monitor. It's a neat concept.
* The world of kart racing game *Sugar Rush* (where Ralph ultimately ends up) is extremely well done; colorful and very attractive to look at, with everything made out of candy, cookies, and cake. Disney could have made a whole movie based on this premise alone. King Candy is a conscious homage to Ed Wynn, who, among many other things, provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in *Alice in Wonderland*.
* Ralph and Vanellope play off of each other well, although I didn't really sense quite the winning chemistry between them that the best Disney duos enjoy. The climactic race through the diverse environments of *Sugar Rush* is fun and exciting, and the stakes only heighten when the Cy-Bugs from *Hero's Duty* invade. King Candy turning out to be the demented Turbo in disguise is a good twist. In the end, Ralph uses his knack for destruction to save the day. In embracing who he is and what he's meant to be, he becomes the hero.

**In Conclusion**

I've been a video game enthusiast since the early 1990s, so I enjoyed the many cameos and references to real-life games. I couldn't get super invested in the story or the characters, however; it was fine, just nothing that really pulled me in. I enjoyed *Wreck-It Ralph* while I was watching it, but it just doesn't have that wow factor for me.

Is Star vs The Forces of Evil worth watching?,"I recently watched through Owl House and Amphibia (both phenomenal shows I can easily recommend) and when it comes to Disney cartoons this is one Im always iffy on checking out. 

I saw the first season and some of season 2 way long ago before season 3 started and thought it was fine. But I’ve never really had an itch to revisit and a big part of that is because of its reputation.

The best way I can describe it is if people say it’s a good show I’ve never heard why they consider it good. I’ve only ever hear people complaining about it. It’s not like Steven Universe where it has a large fandom that loves the show as well as a large hatedom. It’s only people complaining about it whether they liked it in the first place or not (from my perspective). Specifically when season 3 was coming out and season 4 only added fuel to the fire. I know shipping was a big part of that and I already know how that specifically ends because the official Disney YouTube channel spoiled for me when it happened.

"Your thoughts on ""Winnie the Pooh"" (2011)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/adpc8p84jfib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc9dffe279fefb547199313508a095c1ca9947ed

**Overview**

A Disney mainstay for decades, the Winnie the Pooh franchise saw a huge surge in popularity in the late 1990s with the release of the direct-to-video movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin*. A slew of additional movies and TV specials followed (including *The Tigger Movie*, *Piglet's Big Movie*, and *Pooh's Heffalump Movie*, all of which received theatrical releases). With so much animated Pooh material out there, perhaps Walt Disney Animation Studios' own 2011 effort, titled simply *Winnie the Pooh*, failed to stand out. At any rate it received critical praise, but underperformed commercially. As of the present day, it's the last traditionally animated film to be produced by WDAS.

**Point by Point**

* The film opens nostalgically, with a reimagining of the look at Christopher Robin's room and the bouncy theme song featured in *The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. Like its forebear (no pun intended), *Winnie the Pooh* uses the storybook format; the narrator (John Cleese) converses with the characters, and the words on the pages become part of the action.
* The narrative takes direct inspiration from the stories of A.A. Milne; Pooh and his friends search for a new tail for Eeyore, and make plans to rescue Christopher Robin from an imagined monster. It's all very wholesome and good-natured, just as one would expect. The visual highlight of the piece comes when Pooh becomes so delirious with hunger that he imagines himself swimming in a sea of honey.
* There's nothing wrong, per se, with *Winnie the Pooh*. It's a perfectly adequate installment in the franchise. Nothing about it stands out, however; nothing about it suggests to me that it had to be a feature film produced by WDAS when it could have been a direct-to-DVD offering from one of the lesser studios. The story is just fluff, and none of the songs are the least bit memorable. And, at only sixty-three minutes, it's short.

**In Conclusion**

Of course, as an adult, I hardly represent the film's target audience. While most other movies in the WDAS canon manage to cater to broader demographics, *Winnie the Pooh* is decidedly for young children. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I do have to file it under the bottom tier of my personal ranking, however; even as a fan of Pooh in my childhood, this film simply didn't resonate with me. Again, not because it's bad, but simply because it isn't meant for me.

"Your thoughts on ""Tangled"" (2010)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mcs3wnc9guhb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26f484a84131d0bd56b531a6f99d213b305f315c

**Overview**

*Tangled*, Disney's long overdue adaptation of “Rapunzel”, marks the point where things really started to go right for Walt Disney Animation Studios again. It was in production for six years (it took them that long to get the hair looking right), and, to this day, is still the most expensive animated film ever produced. It was a critical and commercial success, however (which hadn't really happened for WDAS since *Lilo & Stitch*), and set Disney on the path to a new and brighter era.

**Point by Point**

* Though *Tangled* uses computer-animated graphics, the animators were keen to evoke the “warmth and intuitive feel” of Disney's classic, traditionally animated movies. The visuals are amazing; warm, bright, colorful, and full of light. Up until this more focused viewing of *Tangled*, I had never really appreciated how beautiful a movie in the computer-animated style could look. I had always thought of every movie done in this style – whether it be *Toy Story*, *Shrek*, or *Madagascar* – to look essentially the same. But now I can see that's not true at all. *Tangled* has taught me that a computer-animated film can look every bit as lush and magnificent as a traditionally animated masterpiece like *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King*.
* As is usual for a Disney princess, Rapunzel captures my heart almost immediately. She's endearing, sympathetic, and bursting at the seams with hidden strength. Her long, long, *long* hair looks tremendous; it may have been an arduous labor, but the animators got it right. I love how it almost takes on a life of its own, and how Rapunzel can wield it as though it's a set of extra limbs; it doesn't get in her way or trip her up at all. She is its master.
* Mother Gothel is an inspired villain, representative of a subtle, insidious evil; the kind of evil that seems to love you and care for you, but only so far as it can use you to get what it wants. Gothel keeps Rapunzel in her place with gaslighting and emotional abuse, and, when she seems to do something nice for Rapunzel, it's only to keep her satiated and quiet. (Incidentally, how does Rapunzel know when her birthday is? The only possible explanation is that Gothel told her, but why would she do that?)
* Seeing Rapunzel experience being outside for the first time, after living her whole life as a shut-in, is an invigorating moment. That she also feels guilty about disobeying Gothel is a good bit of character exploration for her.
* Flynn takes Rapunzel to a tavern full of thugs and ruffians in an attempt to scare her off of her quest, but, as is her power as a Disney princess, she effortlessly charms the lot of them, and the song 'I've Got a Dream' is a catchy one. The action during the escape from the tavern is exciting, and Rapunzel using her hair's glowing properties to light their way out of the dark, flooded cavern is clever.
* Rapunzel and Flynn visiting the town during the festival is a good sequence. The little girls braiding Rapunzel's hair up for her is a cute moment, and the dance segment is joyful and energetic. The flying lanterns look really, really great; one of the most visually impressive moments in a Disney animated movie in a long time. And, as far as mood goes, I'd say that moment with Rapunzel and Flynn in the boat together is on a par with 'Kiss the Girl' from *The Little Mermaid*.
* Gothel's plan to gaslight Rapunzel back into her arms and win her everlasting trust and gratitude leads to the requisite “all is lost” moment, with Rapunzel back in her tower and Flynn awaiting the gallows. The way that Rapunzel comes to the realization of her true identity is a bit tenuous, but dramatic nonetheless. It all leads up to the climactic scene in the tower, where Flynn sacrifices his life to secure Rapunzel's freedom, and cuts her hair off. Gothel turns to dust, as she should have done ages ago.
* But wait! It looks as though not all of Rapunzel's healing powers were tied up in her hair. In what is surely a nod to the original Grimm tale, her tears bring Flynn back to life. Rapunzel returns to her parents and her throne, and all is well!

**In Conclusion**

The return to form for WDAS that began with *The Princess and the Frog* culminates with *Tangled*. Go figure that it would take a couple of princess movies to get Disney back on track; princess movies have always been their forte, after all. Welcome back, Disney, we missed you.

Disney Plus ended the Streaming Wars. We lost. The End.,"Excerpts from the article.

The more than 20% hike in prices means Disney+ will now cost twice the original price when the service debuted four years ago, and Hulu’s ad-free tier is now more expensive than the most popular Netflix plan.

Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCU and even Netflix have all raised prices this year in a drive toward profitability. And as Iger announced Wednesday for Disney, password-sharing crackdowns are also en route.

The announcement puts to an end much of the initial allure that led to the popularity of streaming. When Netflix first offered its pioneering service for only $8 a month, millions of people signed up, eager to have access to the company’s expansive catalog for just a fraction of the cost of the traditional cable bundle. That served as the genesis of the streaming era, with legacy entertainment companies such as Disney racing to launch their own direct-to-consumer products at unsustainably low costs.

Now that is all over.

Those massive libraries of content are growing more expensive (not to mention shrinking) by the year. In fact, consumers who bundle just a few streamers together in 2023 will find that the final cost is effectively the same as basic cable. Couple that reality with the introduction of ads into streaming and the end product eerily resembles on-demand cable.

It’s an ironic end to the streaming wars. After pouring billions and billions of dollars into constructing supposedly revolutionary streaming platforms, and decimating the business models that had offered the industry stability for decades, the ultimate product looks awfully similar to what companies and consumers were trying to break free from in the first place.

"Your thoughts on ""The Princess and the Frog"" (2009)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m7po7jeay8hb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c77d5cfc074db63456c35db0c31e505da35a57a

**Overview**

A brief return to traditional animation, as well as a more lasting return to what makes a Disney animated movie feel special. Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker (who had worked on *The Great Mouse Detective*, *The Little Mermaid*, and *Aladdin*, among others), *The Princess and the Frog* is a good ol' princess movie, visually evocative of classics like *Cinderella* and *Lady and the Tramp*, with the Broadway musical format of the 1990s films. It was a moderate success, but ran into its share of roadblocks; not only did it have to contend with James Cameron's *Avatar* taking the world by storm at about the same time, but it also struggled to draw male viewership. (Boys don't care about a movie with the word “princess” in the title.)

**Point by Point**

* The visuals are striking right away, with the warm, glowing pink of Charlotte's bedroom, and the movie looks good throughout, from the streets of 1920s New Orleans to the bright and colorful bayou, alive with detail. The part with all the fireflies lighting up the swamp is particularly good.
* Tiana is immediately likable as a protagonist, and her song 'Almost There' is a good one, with a visual flair evocative of the best Renaissance musicals. Naveen starts out shallow and lazy, but isn't unlikable. Even Charlotte, who is spoiled and pampered, isn't antagonistic. She could easily have become the wicked stepsister to Tiana's Cinderella, but the writers didn't take her in that direction. In fact, she's even supportive of Tiana finally marrying Naveen, when she'd had her own eye on the Prince.
* Dr. Facilier is definitely the best villain we've seen since the 1990s (although the competition isn't exactly fierce); he's stylish and well-designed, fun to look at and listen to. His song, 'Friends on the Other Side', is a highlight of the film. He seems powerful, but, in fact, all of his strength comes from his demonic benefactors. His desperation to appease them is apparent throughout the story, and his ghastly fate – being dragged down to hell when the demons have finally lost their patience with him – is perfectly fitting.
* *The Princess and the Frog* also boasts a couple of good comedic sidekicks in Louis, an alligator who longs to be a jazz musician, and Ray, a Cajun firefly who's in love with a star. They both do a good job of providing extra substance to Tiana and Naveen's adventure, and, in a sad twist, Ray actually ends up dying at the hands (or foot, rather) of Dr. Facilier. It's highly unusual for a comic sidekick to be killed off, but, in a magical moment, he appears to take his place as a newborn star beside his beloved “Evangeline”.
* Ultimately, when all hope of breaking the curse seems to have been lost, Tiana and Naveen are content to remain as frogs together. And it really does look like that's how their story will end, as they join together in froggish matrimony, in a swamp ceremony overseen by Mama Odie. In a clever twist, however, Tiana becomes a princess by marrying Naveen, and her kiss subsequently breaks the spell and returns them both to normal. A satisfying conclusion follows, with everyone receiving their requisite happy ending.

**In Conclusion**

*The Princess and the Frog* is a breath of fresh air after the mostly mediocre Disney entries that preceded it, and is a welcome departure from the era's dominant trends in animation; 3D visuals, acerbic humor, and rapid-fire pop culture references. It's a good ol' princess movie, full of music and magic; a welcome return to form.

"Your thoughts on ""Bolt"" (2008)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9k4y1es58ugb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=599f3c3966172afc5629ec56d1adcdae0b615651

**Overview**

*Bolt* isn't quite Disney at the top of its game, but it's definitely an indicator of even greater quality to come in the ensuing years; it's the dividing line between a dysfunctional and unremarkable past (*Home on the Range*, *Chicken Little*, *Meet the Robinsons*) and a brighter, more hopeful future (*The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, *Frozen*). Overseen by John Lasseter, who had just been brought over from Pixar, *Bolt*'s box office was nothing to write home about, but it garnered mostly positive reviews, which, in itself, was something Walt Disney Animation Studios had been missing of late.

**Point by Point**

* Bolt is cute throughout the film; as a puppy he's *super* cute. We see him playing happily with his squeaky carrot toy when Penny comes in to adopt him. Five years later, Penny and Bolt are the stars of an action TV series! Thanks to the producer's avant-garde approach to character motivation, Bolt thinks it's all real, and that he really does possess super powers like super strength, super speed, heat vision, and a “super bark”. The destructive, action-packed chase through the streets of Los Angeles is a lively way to open the movie and introduce the concept, and, if you're unfamiliar with *Bolt*, then Disney has succeeded in tricking you too; you're going to get a movie much different than the one suggested by this intro.
* Sadly, because Bolt is meant to think that it's all real, he doesn't get to live the life of an ordinary dog. He doesn't get to relax and have fun. He's always anxious and on edge, always on guard against the bad guys who could be coming for Penny. (My nervous little guy freaks out every time someone walks past our apartment. I feel bad for Bolt having to live in that headspace *all* the time.) Penny doesn't even get to take him home with her; he has to live in a trailer on set. It's quite sad.
* Of course, the producer decides to film a two-parter that ends on a cliffhanger, with Penny in the clutches of the evildoers. This leaves Bolt frantic, and he doesn't intend to wait around to film the second half. He needs to rescue Penny *now*! In his attempt to escape the studio, however, he ends up falling into a shipping box and being rushed clear across the country to New York. Here he meets Mittens, a stray cat who's been running a protection racket on some pigeons. As Bolt is convinced Mittens is involved with Penny's kidnapping, she becomes involved in his quixotic trek back to Hollywood.
* It's fun to watch Mittens freak out while Bolt continuously tries to do “super” things like jump onto a speeding train or melt a padlock by staring at it. Eventually, however, Bolt comes to the tough realization that his powers are just Hollywood make-believe, and Mittens teaches him how to do normal dog things like begging for snacks and playing fetch. Along their way they meet up with a hamster (and super fan of Bolt) named Rhino, who provides additional comic relief. The song 'Barking at the Moon' is pleasant, if forgettable, and plays over a heartwarming montage of Bolt connecting with his inner dog as the trio travels across the country.
* Bolt finally makes it back to the studio, only to find himself replaced by a similar-looking dog. It wasn't Penny's idea; the showrunners insisted. To Bolt's eyes, however, it looks as though Penny's affection for him was as fake as his heat vision. It's a sad moment. Luckily, he doesn't labor under that illusion for long.
* Things escalate quickly after that. A fire breaks out in the studio and Penny is trapped. Bolt rushes in to save her. They try to get out, but Penny is overcome by the smoke and collapses. Bolt makes the decision to stay with her. Then he gets the idea to bark loudly through a vent, alerting the firefighters to their location. His “super” bark saves the day.
* Penny and Bolt retire from show business after this, and, in the Disney tradition of the family adopting the stray, Mittens gets to stay (and so does Rhino). The film closes out with a cute montage of Penny and the pets doing lots of fun things together.

**In Conclusion**

*Bolt* isn't particularly innovative or challenging, but it's a cute, heartwarming story, with lovable characters, and it feels like WDAS getting back on track after several post-Renaissance years of mediocrity. Particularly as a dog person, I liked it.

**Overview**

Inspired very loosely by a children's book called *A Day With Wilbur Robinson* (to give you an idea of just how loosely, the book's story doesn't feature time travel at all), *Meet the Robinsons* is Disney's second fully computer animated film, following the commercial success of *Chicken Little*. Although WDAS had begun catering to more traditional visual trends in animation, *Meet the Robinsons* was a box office bomb, and is yet another Disney film of the 2000s relegated to obscurity.

**Point by Point**

* *Meet the Robinsons* focuses on an orphan named Lewis who also happens to be a brilliant inventor. After his latest invention destroys a science fair, he gets pulled into a time-twisting adventure and ends up meeting his future family - the titular Robinsons - in a society built on his inventions.
* *Meet the Robinsons* is a pleasant enough film, but not very remarkable. Lewis and Wilbur are both likable protagonists, but the story is a bit flat for a time travel adventure. The various members of the family Robinson are two-dimensional, and aren't given any time to shine. They're just set dressing. There's an octopus butler, a pair of twins who live in tree planters, and a superhero-themed pizza delivery guy voiced by Adam West, but none of them actually *do* anything. The twist - that Lewis is actually the patriarch of the Robinson clan - helps spice things up a little, but not much comes of it.
* Bowler Hat Guy has a good aesthetic going on; classic vaudeville, complete with black cape and twirly mustache. He's funny and colorful, but his partner in crime - an evil robot Lewis invents in the future - has zero personality. The revelation of Bowler Hat Guy's true identity is clever enough, but seems to come out of nowhere, with no prior hints or foreshadowing.
* Of course, everything wraps up well for everyone, and the ending is sweet and satisfying as Lewis' destiny comes full circle. It just feels like it ought to have more to it.

**In Conclusion**

I can understand why *Meet the Robinsons* failed to find an audience. It's not that it's bad, it's just...bland. There isn't a lot to it. The story and the characters have potential, but they simply never rise to the occasion. *Encanto*, years later, does a much more competent job of telling a story about a large, colorful family.

**Overview**

After spending the first half of the 2000s getting shown up repeatedly by Pixar and DreamWorks, Walt Disney Animation Studios decided to bite the bullet and produce its first fully computer-animated feature film. (*Dinosaur* had used mostly live-action backgrounds.) Reviews weren't particularly glowing, and it's too bad WDAS abandoned the traditional animation model, but, tellingly, *Chicken Little* was a greater commercial success than anything the studio had put out in the preceding five years.

**Point by Point**

* In this version of the story, Chicken Little's frenzied fears of the sky falling are debunked almost immediately, and he is made a local laughingstock. The core conflict here is that Chicken Little feels unsupported by his father, Buck Cluck, who didn't stand by him when he'd tried to warn everyone of the sky falling. In an attempt to make his father proud, Chicken Little joins the school baseball team. Against all odds (and the laws of physics), he scores a homerun and helps his team win the pennant. All seems well, but then...something falls from the sky and hits Chicken Little on the head.
* As it turns out, it's not a piece of sky, but of an alien spaceship. Things go off the rails a bit at this point, and there's a whole thing about the aliens losing their baby and invading Earth to find him, and Chicken Little's dad learns to be more supportive, and blah blah blah. There's really not much there. The story is extremely insubstantial, and the characters are wholly two-dimensional.
* With the newly 3D castle logo at the beginning of the film, you can see that Disney is really leaning into the new animation model. They also lean hard into the trends of the time. Animated movies produced in the early 2000s were expected to be rife with pop culture references, and *Chicken Little* definitely checks that box. In the film's first few minutes we see a clip from *Raiders of the Lost Ark* playing at a movie theater, and popular songs like Queen's 'We Are the Champions' and the Spice Girls' 'Wannabe' are performed by the characters throughout. Also present are the snide, unpleasant characters and crude humor typical of this era in children's animation. (The problem, generally speaking, was that the industry learned the wrong lessons from *Shrek*, frequently copying its cynical tone and sardonic humor while failing to recapture its genius and heart.)
* Oh, and just one more thing that I find a bit troubling. Foxy Loxy gets her personality completely altered by the aliens, and, despite their offer to put her back to normal, the big pig who likes Barbra Streisand is all like, ""Oh, no, she's perfect!"" and immediately takes her as his girlfriend. Does that creep anybody else out? I realize that Foxy was the typical mean girl, but we're talking about a child here. Whatever her comeuppance should be, I'm not comfortable with her being effectively lobotomized for laughs.

**In Conclusion**

*Chicken Little* is an embarrassment. Disney embarrassed themselves with this one. The studio that brought us *The Little Mermaid*, *The Lion King*, and *Mulan* climbed down into the mud to try to curry favor with the audience of *Shark Tale*, and the result is not pretty. The story is shallow, the humor doesn't land, and the characters are cruel and unlikable. I think I have more respect for *The Black Cauldron* than I do for *Chicken Little*. At least the makers of *The Black Cauldron* were trying to make something that would matter; at least they could go down with their heads held high and their dignity intact. *Chicken Little* is nothing but a cheap, cynical cash-in.

"Your thoughts on ""Home on the Range"" (2004)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6kp7yipkojfb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=781f6cc94d46777225696da2485243eacd742a69

**Overview**

Throughout its development, *Home on the Range* saw many inventions and reinventions. The project started out as a coming-of-age adventure set against a cattle drive, then became a ghost story about undead cattle rustlers, then was reconceived as a story about a small bull who idolizes horses. In its final form, it's a comedy about three cows who become bounty hunters in order to save their bankrupt farm. The eclectic production history of *Home on the Range* is perhaps indicative of the mindset of Walt Disney Animation Studios at this time; Disney seemingly didn't know what they wanted, what audiences wanted, or what their identity looked like in a world where they had been bested at their own game by several rival studios.

**Point by Point**

* It's been quite a while since we've had a WDAS movie that I'd say was strictly for kids (since *The Rescuers Down Under*, maybe?), but *Home on the Range* simply doesn't boast anything to recommend it to adult viewers. It's a fun, zany adventure for children, but the story is weak, the characters are two-dimensional, and the humor is overly reliant on corny gags and referential nods (at one point, for no reason at all, a chicken quotes Tim Burton's *Batman*).
* I liked the three cows, I'll give the film that. I wouldn't mind seeing the further adventures of brash Maggie, flighty Grace, and prissy Mrs. Calloway. Unfortunately, none of the other characters were really compelling to me. Buck, the horse who dreams of being an action hero, is actually kind of annoying most of the time. Rico, the crooked bounty hunter, has no personality beyond being a Clint Eastwood type. And the villain, Alameda Slim, is unimpressive, with one of the most tenuous motives ever (he's a former ranch hand whose employers...didn't respect him enough, I guess?). Granted, the sequence in which we see Slim employ his Pied Piper-esque ability to hypnotize cattle with his yodeling is pretty good, with the psychedelic visuals reminding me of sequences from *Dumbo* and *Alice in Wonderland*. The film's finale is action-packed, though not very thrilling.

**In Conclusion**

*Home on the Range* is a bit of fluff, nothing more. Like most Disney animated movies of its era, it was a commercial failure and has since been relegated to obscurity. Some of its contemporaries, like *Atlantis* and *Treasure Planet*, deserved better than the hands they were dealt, but I can't say the same for *Home on the Range*. It's nothing short of baffling that this came out of the same studio that gave us *The Lion King*.

**Overview**

With an eye on the success of *The Lion King*, Michael Eisner put in an order for more naturalistic, animal-centered films. Needless to say, *Brother Bear* did not achieve the heights of that 1990s favorite; Walt Disney Animation Studios was still in the reeds at this point, struggling for relevance amidst more popular animated offerings from Pixar and DreamWorks. Like most WDAS films from this era, *Brother Bear* exists in relative obscurity today.

**Point by Point**

* As with most Disney animated movies, there's no denying that *Brother Bear* looks good, especially after Kenai has been turned into a bear and the backgrounds become consciously more colorful. The music is good too, although the return of Phil Collins sadly fails to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was the *Tarzan* soundtrack. The opening song (performed by Tina Turner) is sweeping and energetic enough to get the blood pumping, but the epic feel doesn't last.
* Kenai is irresponsible and not very likable at first, but, I mean, I get it. He wanted his totem to be strength or bravery or something manly like that, and then the old lady shaman tells him, in front of everybody, that his totem is love? I'd probably be disappointed too. As it turns out, Kenai has a lot to learn about love.
* The middle brother, Denahi, starts out with a more sensible perspective, if a tad unrelatable. (I freely admit that if my big brother had died saving me from being mauled by a bear, I'd be a lot less forgiving of said bear.) When he believes that Kenai has also fallen victim to the bear, however, he's fresh out of pacifism, and vows revenge.
* The bear cub, Koda, is cute and likable, and he and Kenai, during their journey to the salmon run, enjoy a dynamic similar to that of Shrek and Donkey. (Kenai is grumpy, and Koda won't shut the hell up.) The moose duo provides adequate comedy relief.
* It's a dramatic moment when both Kenai and the audience realize that the bear Kenai killed previously was, in fact, Koda's mother, and suddenly we're seeing the raging beast from earlier in a whole new light. Kenai's heartfelt confession to Koda feels a bit leaden, however, especially with the blandish Phil Collins song playing over it.
* The ending is pretty satisfying, with Kenai and Denahi reconciling, and Kenai electing to remain a bear for Koda's sake. I suppose this all shakes out all right because of the events that started it. If Koda's mother had initiated the aggression, then ending her would have been the right thing for Kenai to do. You don't need to feel guilty for protecting yourself and your family from a dangerous animal. All the bear did, however, was help herself to some fish that were freely on offer due to Kenai's negligence. Kenai's violent response was disproportionate, and led only to death and suffering. Now he's redeemed himself, and learned about love.

**In Conclusion**

I was nineteen in 2003, and didn't get around to watching *Brother Bear* until years later. As such, it dwells well outside the purview of my nostalgia. It's easy to be underwhelmed by a children's movie that wasn't part of your childhood. I fully acknowledge that I was not the target audience for this. Although it has its strengths (good visuals, mostly likable characters, a story with a moral), it's decidedly mediocre.

**Overview**

The concept of ""*Treasure Island* in outer space"" had been kicking around Walt Disney Animation Studios for years; directors John Musker and Ron Clements had been pushing for it since the 1980s. Though the setting doesn't do much to enhance the story (pretty much everything that happens in space in the movie could have happened just as easily on the high seas), the fanciful juxtaposition of tall sailing ships against the stars (and the period dress worn by the characters) creates an aesthetic not dissimilar to steampunk. Unfortunately, *Treasure Planet* was a giant bomb at the box office (it had to compete with Harry Potter, James Bond, and *The Santa Clause 2*), but, like *Atlantis*, it has since gained a greater appreciation among Disney fans.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals, as usual, are impressive. The animators set out to make a sci fi film with warm overtones, rather than dark and sterile and metallic, and I'd say they succeeded. The ships are made of wood, the solar powered sails are full of sunlight, and the outer space scenery is colorful, and characterized by bright, striking phenomena like comets and star storms. The characters themselves look good too, and cover a broad range of alien designs.
* Jim's skysurfing scene at the beginning is visceral and exciting, and is a good introduction to Jim's character. He's a problem child who's failing in school and frequently in trouble with the law. He wants to do better, though, especially for his mother's sake. Delbert is a good foil for Jim; a more responsible and grounded character to play off of.
* Of course, getting Long John Silver right is a key part of any *Treasure Island* adaptation. If you whiff on that, you might as well chuck the whole project. Luckily, this version of Silver - a charismatic cyborg with a multipurpose Roto-Rooter for a cybernetic arm - fills the role well. He's a likable  scoundrel who takes Jim under his wing and turns out to be more of a sympathetic rogue than an outright villain. His pet shapeshifter, Morph, provides the requisite sidekick antics.
* *Treasure Planet* really has only one song, but it's a great one. 'I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)' is a highlight of the film, and it has a place on my regular playlist. It plays over a montage that's partially flashbacks to Jim's early childhood and his father walking out on the family, and partially Silver teaching him how to be a sailor (or spacer, I suppose).
* The film slows down a bit in the third act, after arriving at Treasure Planet. I wouldn't say it gets boring, but it does drag its feet a bit. Things pick up again, however, once the characters discover Flint's enormous vault at the core of the planet; a terrific set piece. And there's Flint's cold remains, sitting at the center of it all, like a dead king. The loot of a thousand worlds, and what did he do with it? He stockpiled it here and then died counting it.
* And, of course, he rigged the whole thing to explode in case anyone found it; better to destroy it all than share it. Silver gets his moment of redemption when he gives up the treasure to save Jim's life, and their escape through the portal is an exciting climax. Of course, Silver goes free at the end, but not before giving Jim a handful of treasure with which to finance a better life for himself and his mother.

**In Conclusion**

*Treasure Planet* is a well-crafted adventure film, definitely one of the best Disney animated films of its era, and it deserved better than it got. It looks good, it's got a great song, and the characters are developed and voice acted well. The first decade of the twenty-first century was a rough one for WDAS, though. Children's animation was in the midst of a cultural flux, and contemporary films like *Shrek*, *Ice Age*, *Madagascar*, *Finding Nemo*, and *The Incredibles* were taking all the oxygen. We have a bit further to go yet before Disney would rediscover its footing. In the meantime, I'd place *Treasure Planet* solidly on my A tier.

Ranking All 61 Disney Films,"After coming from Disney World earlier this year, I wished to watch all of these films to just simply understand everything around me when I stayed there. This was quite a fun experience and eye opening experience.  I knew what most films would entail, but to actually see the full picture, it was nice. For the ranking, It was based on the idea ""would I recommend this to somebody?"" mixed in with my own personal opinion. And how my recommendations go, ""does it offer me something new?"". Just how I like to rank. I decided to rank all these films after watching all of them because I wanted to see how well they held up in my head.

&#x200B;

1. The Lion King - I can't simply think of a more perfect film that anyone can enjoy, no matter the background or language.
2. Beauty and the Beast - It's the perfect Disney movie, There's nothing more to say but watch it, also I love inside of the castle, backgrounds were amazing!
3. Aladdin - I think it set a whole new standard on how children's movies could be done, while just being all around fun. Also I'm middle eastern and I like the setting.
4. Lilo & Stitch - All the characters were great and you wanted to see them happy, love the setting, Hawaiian roller coaster ride is a fun song.
5. The Little Mermaid - I can understand people who rank it at first, it's great, I put a lot of the golden Disney films up high cause I can't think of any flaws about them. Ariel's animation is very expressive, that lead character animator should get a raise, colors are great and vibrant.
6. The Hunchback of Notre Dame - It grand, centering on one location is a novel idea for a film, and Esmeralda has a great design. Quasi Modo has an even greater design cause they had to make the main character hideous but good looking to watch. The gargoyles weren't horrible and are in Quasi's head, if he just has a giant cauldron of boiling water ready to pour on the guards climbing up its not impossible he did everything else just imagining the gargoyles doing it for him.
7. Mulan - Great message, love the China setting, weak villain that was not threatening in the slightest, Mulan is the only Disney princess with a body count, music is great, i like that scene when Shan Yu orders a sniper to kill the running away solider, and cuts with a cymbal playing.
8. Encanto - Best Disney film since Wreck-It Ralph, I love how beautiful the home looks and how much you explore through it, and the premise is great and well realized. Vibrant colors, great music, great characters, and I love the setting. I love it when films are set are drenched in a single country's culture.
9. The Jungle Book - The biggest surprise to me, cause I didn't expect much from it for being so old. Music is great, I love how small the story and setting feels. I think the message of Mowgli having to return to the man village is good although I can't put my finger on why funnily enough.
10. Peter Pan - It's one of the Disney films that just feels like a childhood fairy tail come to life. And surprisingly a boy in green tights and fights with a small knife is really cool to me for some reason lmao. I wish the Indians in the film were actually treated with more respect and not caricatures. I found the lost boys annoying. Music is too great, love those iconic visuals, and last thing, that whistle that announces Peter Pan's presence is so amazing.
11. Pinocchio - It's surprising how good of a film this is for their second attempt, Italy is cool.
12. Hercules - Such a great blend of the most bizarre things, I didn't feel the climax was all that suspenseful cause I didn't understand what made the titans threatening or if gods could even die or not. Music is fantastic.
13. The Emperor’s New Groove - It good, I remember catching this on the Disney channel a couple of times.
14. Wreck-It Ralph - Best Disney film that is not supported by being a musical, soundtrack is still fun though but I already like daft punk so its not hard. Gamer.
15. Tangled - I love how great this film is, but it doesn't do anything that exceptional, like it's just missing something to really put it in S tier. Flynn Rider is best Disney Prince. Rapunzel is best Disney princess. Rapunzel is the only Disney Princess with a negative body count.
16. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - I was a Winnie the Pooh kid and this is great, holds up well because the hundred acre woods feels like it's own world with it's own logic which i love. Ending the film with a segment about Tigger is a bit weird though.
17. Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs - It's a film that's mostly aesthetic and that aesthetic is magical. It's really unique how this film still holds up after all this time.
18. Alice in Wonderland - Fun experience, that idea about how eating and drinking could make you smaller or bigger was cool and I see why Burton used it more in the remake. I don't really like that one segment about a walrus wanting to eat fish though because it drags down the momentum of Alice wandering further into Wonderland.
19. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The characters and their designs are great, they really know how to use the color blue, Mole is a fun character I enjoyed watching, the action was good.
20. Zootopia - It's cool, I's really weird the revival era has very little musicals(disney's best genre), it's a good mystery/adventure film.
21. Frozen - A movie covered by the music, Love in an open door is the best song, god I hate the fixer upper song because it doesn't further the plot of characters in any way. The concepts and premise are great but pretty underdeveloped. Hans is a good villain and great concept, but just undeveloped.
22. Tarzan - It fine.
23. Dumbo - Baby Mine is such a great song, it's one hour so doesn't waste your time. I like the rat he's a nice guy. You know, when thinking about the bad stereotypes in these films, with the exclusion of Fantasia, they all are characters that help contribute to the plot, so at least they're not all trying to be a mockery for the sake of joke.
24. Cinderella - It feels like a tv movie, what saves it is Cinderella herself being an engaging character, and evil Step Mother is devilish.
25. Treasure Planet - I like the relationship of Jim and John, although John's accent I can never get use to. Scifi/1700s aesthetic is neat, my god how did the captain and smart dog guy get into a romance??
26. Moana - It wasn't bad. Doesn't do anything for me, Water animation is great and fun character.
27. Robin Hood - Charming, Robin Hood is fun to watch.
28. Sleepy Beauty - Good animation, she has a blue dress actually lol, it's classic fantasy.
29. Meet the Robinsons - It's a good watch although a lot of characters are just gags. It's a movie only Disney could make, with that message Keep Moving Forward and moving on from failure.
30. Bolt - Have I ever mentioned how much I don't like dog movies? Well I do, but this one is good, I like the action scenes at the beginning and I wish more of these movies had flow like it. I only hear Hannah Montana's voice and also I hate that mother so much, the lawyer guy I once hated but he grew on me for being an absolute terrible person. That mother is worse, jokes in the movie weren't bad.
31. Pocahontas - A film without a climax but good animation tho, has two good songs.
32. The Three Caballeros - The disney movie I watched the most as a kid although beginning drags and it feels like a never ending party at the end. I love scene of Baia the most, and the dance sequence is catchy.
33. The Great Mouse Detective - It's a good film, probably should go higher but doesn't stick with me as much as others. Basil is a fun protagionst tho, villain is fun, climax is cool. Why is this lower than pocahontas again?
34. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - It's funny how the film is actually just a prison escape movie and that makes it better lol.
35. The Princess and the Frog - It's fine, could be better, could be worse, that firefly wasn't actually annoying as I remember, the movie isn't bad but nothing to write home about except the setting is a cool idea, man I wish New Orleans was a real place.
36. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad - Watched this film at 3am cause I couldn't think of any better time to watch it and it did not disappoint, I love that line about the honest way, cracks me up all the time. Headless Horseman felt like I was a kid again at halloween, I love the segments between the two stories, cool set and funny line to end the movie with lmao.
37. Strange World - Most consistent out of the latest non-musical disney films. I liked the noses and character designs. Although I do question it's world cause why are there multiple skin tones if they all came from the same place? The ""strange world"" felt unorganized, i liked the twist but I feel that would make the characters have an existential crisis tho.
38. Frozen II - Nice animation, lost in the woods is great, why are you mentioning hans multiple times when he has nothing to do with the plot? Why do you keep referencing the original, it's like they don't trust me? It stole Bernard's plotline from The Rescuers Down Under.
39. Raya and the Last Dragon - It's pretty good if you exclude Namari's, Sisu's, and the core message's writing.
40. The Rescuers - I liked the main two rats, Bernard is so great, and the other girl one is fun to watch too. The secret society of international rats was a fun visual and Bernard dressed as Mario makes me feel whole. The little girl wasn't completely annoying.
41. The Rescuers Down Under - Pretty much the same experience as the first film, but John Candy is in this one.
42. Lady and the Tramp - I don't like dog movies but this had nice animation and one iconic scene.
43. Winnie the Pooh - This film exists. I did not expect that end credit scene.
44. Saludos Amigos - It was novel, pretty dated I presume since it's from the 40s talking about modern day culture lol. more Three Caballeroes ain't a bad thing. I love Jose, he cool.
45. Bambi - I liked how the villain ""Man"" wasn't shown and more of an effect from the world, like man is a part of nature. Turns out the reason ""Man"" wasn't shown is because of budget reasons lol.
46. Fantasia - Boring. But more memorable than 2000.
47. Fantasia 2000 - Better than the original, but not as memorable as t he original, I liked the celebrities and presentation between segments. I liked how each segment has a loose narrative to follow, helped make the film enjoyable to watch.
48. Big Hero 6 - Cool setting, first time Disney does a \*Japan setting, I love when Disney does an Asia setting!
49. The Fox and the Hound - Not bad but also not good.
50. The Sword in the Stone - I like it but it's more like a dvd sequel movie that's 3 completed episodes of a cancelled pilot thrown together.
51. Brother Bear - Gorgeous animation and backgrounds, neat story but idk, nothing to comment about it except I like the animation the most.
52. Oliver & Company - bad, Billy Joel exists and that is not okay, why should i worry is not bad and kind of a bop, I like the new york setting aesthetic .
53. Home on the Range - Not good, reminds me American history textbooks and maps from fourth grade with it's animation. Some jokes were kinda funny.
54. The Black Cauldron - The only disney fantasy film from the 80s, it has that small type of aesthetic  to it. It bad.
55. The Aristocats - I don't like this film. The dogs were so goddamn annoying, it's neat to have a french setting for once as I do like the country. The animation isn't that good, such a weird ending man.
56. Make Mine Music - It good, but wish inconsistent because not all segments are about music. It's weird how it isn't on disney plus? Also more Andrews sisters is always a good thing. That is a whale.
57. Melody Time - It fine, I now understand what the hell a Pesco Bill is and want to know why he has a restaurant in Frontierland.
58. Ralph Breaks the Internet - Awful movie that goes against the original's themes, and disney princess scene feels like the writers never even seen any of those films, like Rapunzel saved Eugene's life multiple times during the film.
59. Fun and Fancy Free - Wtf is this film?? It's so bad. Random live action, I want to kill Bongo, that ending gets off the rails so quick, Why do the puppets talk during the mickey short, why are their puppets, who is this man and why can't he throw the puppets into the fire place?
60. Dinosaur - I liked the when the logo showed up and opening sequence, i kinda liked the film, i surprisingly got use to the visuals quick enough. It wasn't a bad idea for a story but I don't really get the worldbuilding.
61. Chicken Little - Was awful in so many ways, but at least it's not the minions.",12,0.71,19,Lampposthead2526,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1690496968.0,False,False,False

"Your thoughts on ""Lilo & Stitch"" (2002)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qv1emiiniceb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ba9d1d5233c2062f4838e3deffae5ffd4fbfba1

**Overview**

Born out of a desire by Disney to produce something light and relatively inexpensive, *Lilo & Stitch* is a deceptively simple story about the meaning of family. Although it lacks the scale and production values of its contemporaries like *Dinosaur*, *The Emperor's New Groove*, and *Atlantis*, it became the most successful and probably most beloved Disney animated film of its era.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals of *Lilo & Stitch* are soft and appealing, using watercolor painted backgrounds, and suit the Hawaiian setting well. It gives the film a sort of soothing quality. The character designs are good too.
* Lilo is cute and funny, and she has a good dynamic with her sister Nani. They're both sympathetic and likable. Even Stitch is cute; I hadn't expected to find Stitch cute but, yeah, in the context of the movie, he's pretty lovable. He was created to be an agent of destruction, but he's also very smart. He can learn. Though he starts out just using Lilo to escape capture by his pursuers, he eventually gets to the point where he enjoys being part of the family. It's a sweet moment when he asks Lilo to take him out on the surfboard, despite his inability to swim or float.
* I won't lie. The moment where Stitch leaves the house with the Ugly Duckling storybook, and goes out into the woods to wait for a family to find him...that got me. That made me feel things.
* The fight at the house is a good action sequence (""Oh, good, the dog found a chainsaw!""), as is the finale where Stitch rescues Lilo from the shark-looking guy. Stitch's eloquent goodbye to Lilo and Nani after he's been captured is sweet, and demonstrates to the alien authorities that he's become civilized. The montage at the end, showing Lilo and Nani and Stitch (and also David and Bubbles and the aliens) doing lots of things together and being a family, is a really nice way to close it all out.

**In Conclusion**

I was in high school in the early 2000s, so we're well past the Disney movies that played their parts in my childhood. I'm much less familiar with the WDAS films of this era, and nostalgia no longer holds sway. As such, I really didn't expect to enjoy *Lilo & Stitch* as much as I did; I thought it would be kind of dumb and annoying; I thought Stitch would be like a Minion. But it's actually really well done, with likable characters and emotional moments. To my pleasant surprise, I'm filing it under Great.

https://preview.redd.it/sri9hktbkxdb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8c5999a1337b8884b348b7db4b279b4709bebc7

**Overview**

The makers of *Atlantis* were passionate about their project, and a lot of care and effort went into it. (They even got the guy who invented the Klingon language for the Star Trek franchise to come in and create an Atlantean language.) It's a quality product, but it simply didn't resonate with audiences. Not only did it face stiff competition at the box office from *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider*, *Dr. Dolittle 2*, and *The Fast and the Furious*, but it had the misfortune of releasing a mere month after the smash hit *Shrek* had turned the business of animated movies on its head.

**Point by Point**

* The movie looks great, and has its own distinct style; more angular, lifelike but rugged, kind of comic bookish (which makes sense, as Mike Mignola, creator of Hellboy, was one of the production designers). It definitely carries an overall air of sci fi, and possibly even some Indiana Jones. The visuals may not appear as lush as those in *Aladdin*, *The Lion King*, or *Tarzan*, but I'd still say the film looks every bit as good as any of Disney's 1990s efforts.
* The characters are fleshed out, interesting, and mostly likable. There's a whole sequence during the expedition where the explorers settle down to camp, and they take the time to elaborate on their motivations and their personal histories. This isn't something you'd normally see in a Disney animated movie, at least not outside the context of an elaborate musical number.
* Speaking of things you wouldn't normally see in a Disney animated movie, how about that encounter with the Leviathan? The explorers' party starts out about two hundred strong, and then that thing comes along on the very first leg of the journey and just wipes out ninety percent of them! Good thing we didn't learn any of their names; that would have been time completely wasted.
* Atlantis looks magnificent, of course, and it's too bad Kida never got to be inducted into the heavily merchandised line of Disney princesses. Milo is a likable hero, and the supporting protagonists - the fast-talking Sweet, the tough tomboy Audrey, and the explosives-obsessed Vinny - are good too. Rourke makes a suitably slimy antagonist; the type who's probably crazy on the inside.
* All in all, *Atlantis* isn't really targeted at young children. There's no songs, there's very little comedy relief, the pacing is much slower, and there's hardly any action to speak of until the finale (which is quite good). Some concepts will also fly over the heads of little kids; even I didn't know what was going on one hundred percent of the time. Unfortunately for Disney, the older kids who might have benefitted from this more serious adventure story were getting their heads turned by Shrek and Lara Croft instead.

**In Conclusion**

*Atlantis* is an admirable effort by Disney to turn out a sci fi adventure film that plays things mostly straight, but it came along at the wrong cultural moment. As noted above, *Shrek* had seized the zeitgeist, and traditional animation was falling by the wayside anyway. Though it languished in relative obscurity for years and was generally viewed by all as a misfire, *Atlantis* has been enjoying some burgeoning reputation in recent times, which it deserves. It's not great, but it's good.

"Your thoughts on ""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ey9krhanxcdb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1da9619ec94c851b11e1952d69ce99951400ef4b

**Overview**

*The Emperor's New Groove* was originally conceived as a more dramatic adventure set against a backdrop of Inca culture and mythology, to be called *Kingdom of the Sun*. Disney had noticed, however, that their funny movies had historically made more money than their more serious ones, and so ultimately switched gears and dialed up the comedy (and eliminated just about every reference to the real life Inca). Released shortly before *Shrek*, *The Emperor's New Groove* was a forebear of what would become a hot trend in children's animated movies during the 2000s; edgier, self-aware humor.

**Point by Point**

* *The Emperor's New Groove* has remarkably little to it. It's an enjoyable film, primarily because it parlays its comedy so well. The story is paper thin, and I found it difficult to care about the protagonists. Kuzco is patently unlikable for most of the film's running time, and Pacha is just kind of boring. (Pacha's kids are funny, though, especially when they're messing with Yzma.) Overall, I really do think the movie could have benefitted from some elaborate and lively musical numbers.
* The villainous Yzma and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk steal the show; the movie is definitely at its best when one or both of them are onscreen, and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton both give great performances. Kitt's performance as a maniacal kitten during the climax is particularly entertaining. (Of course, Kitt was famous for playing Catwoman on TV's *Batman*.

When will Disney release a middle east version of D+ on Windows ?,"Hello, I've been a subscriber to Disney+ since almost the first day it released in Egypt, since release there was no app for middle east viewers \*on windows\*, and there still isn't, is there any news/upcoming release date on when or if it there is going to be ?

why does it matter though ? for me at least

I only have a phone and a laptop, (besides the fact that my phone's screen is 720p), my laptop's screen is a beautiful 1080p OLED, and it frustrates me that i can't watch D+ content at 1080p on my laptop, i can only access it through the website, which for ""security reasons"" only goes up to 720p, the windows app doesn't work in the middle east region, it just says ""not available in your region"" when you open it

Funny enough the mobile version is different from say the US version, its a separate app for the middle east region, why can't they do this on desktop !

So for middle east viewers, not just myself, if i wanted to watch my content at 1080p id have to have a phone/tablet that supports this resolution or a smart TV so this isn't just my issue, I'm sure most people would like to watch D+ on their computers/laptops in FHD, is there any hope of a middle east windows version ?",2,0.63,5,agressive_wc_flusher,:Question: Question,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1689944086.0,False,False,False

Bringing back older Disney shows,"I know by the title it may seem as if I'm asking for reboots, which I'm not ( even though that doesn't sound that bad), but I think there was something different in the older Disney shows. I mean nowadays there's barely anyone watching Disney ( at least the Disney series that are airing currently). Disney channel is recommended for ages 7-17, and do you know who's actually watching the shows? Eight year olds to ten year olds. But when the other Disney shows aired ( Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Lab Rats, Mighty Med, Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place) 7-17 year olds were actually watching Disney. If you're wondering about how I know this, I was a teenager in the mid 2000's. And now I nanny three kids. Those three kids would rather be watching shameless than Disney channel. Now this is where the problem comes in, kids in this generation shouldn't be watching adult shows, but Disney channel isn't fun for them anymore. To test out my theory that older Disney is better than newer Disney, I showed my kids the shows I used to watch. They are completely obsessed with Mighty Med and Hannah Montana now. When I was growing up you could watch Disney channel with your parents, mostly because of the jokes that flew over the kid's heads that the parents understood. But I've noticed how the dialogue and humour has now been dumbed down. When I have kids, I want them growing up with the Disney I had, not the new one. Before I end this post, i just want to share that in 2014 Disney had an average of two million daily viewers, and in 2022 they had just around 180 thousand.

Anyone think we'll get a bit of backstory to that one Skull masquerading as You-Know-Who for Secret Invasion's Finale?,"With the finale steadily approaching in under a week, the one thing I've been wondering the most is how they'll try to address that one Skrull that was revealed to not only be a female, but a female that has been masquerading as Rhodes throughout the series.

Ever since that reveal was hinted at a bit before being made official back on Episode 4, it ended up bringing up a lot of questions every time he came on screen. Like most importantly WHEN did she take up his identity and how long she's been masquerading as him. I'm willing to guess that it's been since Civil War at least because I remember back in Endgame when the group was asked about have any of them been to space before and he was one that hesitated slightly there. In hindsight that should've been something worth raising some eyebrows there a bit.

I'm also wondering if it'll end up answering where the real Rhodes is all this time too by the end of the finale, like whether he's in one of those chambers we've seen earlier in the series or if he's still in recovery after that fight between the Avengers back in Civil War. If it's revealed that he was dead all this time, it would be even more disheartening in itself. 

But with all that said... I'm certain that they would try to make sure that nothing bad would happen to the real Rhodes after this should he actually be brought back. They still have that Armor Wars movie, formerly a TV series, to come out with him in the lead role after all.

"Secret Invasion: a wasted opportunity, and an abandoned one at that...","#Intro
Hello, everyone!
Okay, so this will be a *generally* spoiler-free little ""take"", from a serious MCU nerd who also knows the source material. 

(By ""generally"" I mean that there is the assumption that you know the general plot synopsis, are aware of what skrulls are, their abilities, and their relationships with the other characters, etc. Stuff like that. So, with that in-mind, let's get into it...)

# ""A wasted opportunity""
So, the concept of a secret alien invasion where they can look like us is a brilliant one. It could be a great ""whodunit?"" where absolutely *anyone* could be an alien in disguise. Now, I know there is still one episode to go, but five episodes in, I'm *vastly* underwhelmed. It's had its moments of brilliance, of course. But there is absolutely no way in heckadoodle they are going to fulfill the premise's potential in *one* episode... Let me list some things I think are missing, here.

+ You cannot trust *anyone*. Even Nick Fury! As far as we know, there is no way to tell that a person is human (and not a skrull) except for injuring their flesh, which causes them to reveal themselves, just slightly, or if they die, when they transform completely. So why oh why oh why are our protagonists just casually meeting-up and doing *nothing* to confirm their identities?! They need to be cutting themselves even just a little bit, or heck, just a code phrase! There is *no caution whatsoever* when in this setup they need to be *overly* cautious! And there should *definitely* have been reveals that actually, that person isn't the protagonist after-all(!), to really lean-in to the mystery. 
+ The aliens could potentially disguise themselves *as other aliens* or at the very least as the other aliens' human disguises. *No one* has done this yet, five episodes in! Again, this would really up the stakes, increase the mystery, keep people guessing, etc.
+ Five episodes in, and we don't know why the antagonist is the way he is. He's angry at the humans - Fury in particular - but there's not even a little hint as to *why* . All we've got so far is that Fury hasn't found them a new home, like he promised at the end of Captain Marvel. He *could* be a really cool villain who we might even empaphise with, like the one from Black Panther. But instead, he's just bad... Because... Neither he nor Fury have even explained why/how the skrulls haven't managed to find somewhere on earth yet. There are *tonnes* of places they could go. There's only one million of them, for goodness sake...
+ In the comics, there was this whole thing where there were heroes and villains who were revealed to actually be skrulls! Because the skrulls could copy powers, not just faces and memories. So, we had heroes/villains who we *thought* were dead who actually weren't and heroes/villains who returned from the dead after it was revealed they had been taken by their dopplegangers, for instance. It was a great way for Marvel to ""retcon"" stuff they'd done in the past few years, and it really did keep people guessing! We've *kind-of* seen a little bit of this in the TV show when they revealed in episode 4 that someone we thought was a protagonist we know and love is actually a skrull in disguise, leaving us to wonder ""how long have they been a skrull? Have they *always* been a skrull?!"" but again, it's a really, really underused concept.
+ Too. Few. Episodes. Six episodes just isn't enough, simple as that! This *should* be an *epic* event spanning many, many more episodes, with tonnes more mysteries, fan theories, reveals, etc.
+ Why wasn't *this* ""phase four""? Let's be honest here, folks, I think most of us agree that phase 4 was a bit ""meh"", to-say-the-least. But Secret Invasion would have been *awesome*!!! We could have - *should* have - had the phase 4 movies have tiny little ""Easter eggs"", reveals, post-credits stuff etc leading-up to a big Avengers movie, ala The Infinity Saga. But nope, we get six episodes of TV, and a farely underwhelming ""phase"" instead :-( 

#Abandonment issues...
So, a *huge* number of MCU fans don't actually know this show even *exists* or are aware of it, but not that it's airing. Why? Little-to-no advertising!

For goodness sake, they don't even put Secret Invasion as the first thing on the ""Featured"" every week! And the thumbnail (little image) in the menus that you scroll through to pick what you want, it *doesn't even look like an MCU show* . It looks more like a spy show or something!

No wonder the viewership is so blasted low! Jeese, Marvel/Disney, what are you playing at? :-( It's like they just aren't bothering with it...",4,0.58,18,Due_Habit_1984,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1689800443.0,False,False,False

I think Disney’s poor handling of Disney+ has been because they have 0 idea of what they own and how well known their entire catalog is,"Like, Bob Iger just cancelled High School Musical The Musical The Series after season 4, a show that was expected to at least last 5 seasons as of last year, and is their most popular show behind every high budget show and in fact is more popular than some of their high budget shows. This show spawned one of the biggest pop stars ever too, Olivia Rodrigo. And now that the show is cancelled; Disney+, a KIDS service, is out of the competition for popular kids shows by ANY streaming service now. Why does NETFLIX have more options for kids, it’s insane! 

It’s like they don’t know what they own at all!",0,0.49,37,BCDragon3000,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1689827221.0,False,False,False
"Your thoughts on ""Dinosaur"" (2000)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ogbferg9tycb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cd5d5ff66e1bd2dbffda663eafe543962c3e7de

**Overview**

While Walt Disney Animation Studios had been supplementing their films with computer animation techniques for years, *Dinosaur* was the first of their films to use it entirely, in place of traditional animation. While the characters and creatures are animated, however, most of the backgrounds used in the movie are live-action, and were filmed on location. The blending of the two - the live-action backgrounds with realistic, 3D dinosaurs - makes for what is probably the most lifelike movie in the WDAS canon.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals really do look good. The opening sequence is a highlight, as we watch the orphaned Iguanodon egg make its epic journey far away from its destroyed nest and onto an island populated with prehistoric lemurs. The egg hatches there and the lemurs adopt the baby dinosaur into their family.
* The meteor shower that destroys the island is dramatic, and carries connotations of dread. After all, we know what wiped out the dinosaurs, right? As it turns out, this meteor shower isn't *the* meteor shower, but, upon my first viewing of *Dinosaur*, I did imagine that this might be the beginning of the end of the world.
* Aladar and the surviving lemurs end up joining a multi-species herd of herbivores on a trek across a vast, unforgiving wasteland to reach the idyllic nesting grounds. The herd's leader, Kron, is a cruel and callous master, cracking the whip constantly, and with no sympathy for the weak and infirm. He's presented as the heavy, of course, but it's hard to hold it against him. If we're talking about people, then yes, the strong absolutely should help the weak. But we all know that's not how dinosaurs managed to survive for millions of years. It's a long, hot, hazardous journey, with carnivores dogging their every step, and the herd simply can't slow down for the sake of the stragglers in the back.

**In Conclusion**

There isn't a whole lot to say about *Dinosaur*, really. While it looks great, its story and its characters are rather lackluster. Not much happens over the course of the movie, and nothing that does happen is particularly memorable. I wouldn't call it boring; I wasn't bored. It's just...it is what it is, I guess. *The Land Before Time* manages to be the more interesting and more emotional film about dinosaurs overcoming adversity to reach a lush valley.

Secret Invasion finale = Agents Of SHIELD return?,"I think that the Agents Of SHIELD will be officially returning to the MCU next week in the finale for Secret Invasion, and here is my evidence for my theory...

- Kevin Feige and others have confirmed that AOS *is still part of the MCU* (but has admittedly not confirmed they will be returning)
- The Marvel official website's biography of the MCU version of Nick Fury mentions AOS multiple times. It says nothing about the team and events in the show no longer being canon, or taking place in a different part of the multiverse. 
- AOS has been moved from the ""Marcel Legacies"" collection on Disney+, where all the non-canon stuff is (such as Inhumans, The Gifted or Legion) 
- When the first episode of Secret Invasion aired, the ""Featured""/""Showcase"" area of Disney+ had that show front-and-center... With AOS being the second thing on the list! Now why might that be, I wonder?.. 
- Chloe Bennet - aka ""Quake""/Daisy - did a social media video where she very passionately states that she is *not* going to be in Secret Invasion... Now, lots of characters have been speculated to be returning, lots of fans have been asking the actors if they are going to be in the show... But only *one* actor has adamantly denied it and issued a statement etc... In the past when actors have done this (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, for instance) it has been revealed they were very much lying, so could this be history repeating itself? ;-)

**Overview**

Walt Disney had originally conceived *Fantasia* as an ongoing project, which could be rereleased in perpetuity with new segments added to the mix each time. Obviously, this never panned out. In fact, *Fantasia* was a bit of a boondoggle, and didn't actually begin to make a profit until 1969, after several rereleases. The film enjoyed great commercial success upon its initial home video release in 1991, however, and sales convinced then CEO Michael Eisner that a follow-up could be viable. Thus, *Fantasia 2000* was born, following in the same model as its forebear.

**Point by Point**

* With little preamble, *Fantasia 2000* opens almost immediately onto an energetic and colorful sequence of geometric shapes behaving like butterflies and bats, set to part of Beethoven's 'Symphony No. Five'. It does a good job of setting the tone; whereas the original *Fantasia* opened with a more lilting and cerebral sequence set to Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D minor', this new iteration of *Fantasia* is faster paced and more bombastic.
* *Pines of Rome* shows us a bunch of humpback whales that can glide through the air as easily as they can underwater. It goes on a bit, but it's pretty, and it builds to an exciting finale full of thunder and lightning that sees the whales apparently bursting through the mythical firmament above the Earth and surfacing in outer space.
* *Rhapsody in Blue*, following the lives of four different characters in 1930s New York, is one of the more engaging segments, probably because of its strong, cohesive narrative. The segment immediately following, inspired loosely by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"", is good too. *The Carnival of the Animals* is brief, but fun.
* After a reiteration of *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*, Donald Duck gets his turn with *Pomp and Circumstance*. It's a pleasant bit of fluff, but nowhere near as epic or as legendary as Mickey's contribution.
* *Firebird Suite*, with its impressive visuals and its themes of destruction and rebirth, is a good one to go out on.

**In Conclusion**

There's no avoiding the fact that audiences had changed since the release of the original *Fantasia* in 1940. People back then were much more susceptible to awe and wonder when it came to animation. Entertainment and technology were both much simpler. Fast forward sixty years, however, and Disney wants to introduce the concept of *Fantasia* to generations of people who have grown up on TV, video games, rock n' roll, and Disney's own frenetic films like *Aladdin* and *The Lion King*. Though *Fantasia 2000* adheres to the model of its forebear, it was obvious to me during my viewing that the segments, in general, were faster, livelier, and far less abstract. (And the overall runtime is shorter by almost an hour.) All in all, I'd say Disney did an impressive job of retaining the heart and soul of *Fantasia* while tempering it to fit modern sensibilities.

As much as I respect *Fantasia* for what it is (and I really do respect it), you'll have noticed that I relegate it to the bottom tier in my personal ranking. The format just isn't my cup of tea; I'm not into it. I think I can just about justify placing *Fantasia 2000* in Tier B, however. Though I'm not much likelier to sit down and watch it again for fun, I do appreciate the aesthetic improvements Disney made to the format to make it more digestible.

**Overview**

Tarzan has been an iconic character for over a century now, but, unless you're old enough to remember the series of B movies starring Johnny Weissmuller, chances are Disney's *Tarzan* is the version you're most familiar with. And that's no bad thing. Dozens of Tarzan movies have been released over the decades, dating all the way back to the silent era, but I think Disney's *Tarzan* is likely the best of them all. With Walt Disney Animation Studios at the height of its creative powers, *Tarzan* manages to capture and convey the essence of the character and his world more ably than a nude bodybuilder on a 1930s soundstage could.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and animation are gorgeous, and I think the medium of animation suits Tarzan extremely well. The way he surfs through the trees and swings from vines with both his hands and feet would be impossible to replicate in live-action. Likewise, his relationship with the gorillas is best depicted in typical Disney fashion (with the gorillas able to speak and emote). The music, too, is exemplary, with Phil Collins performing the songs as part of the narrative, rather than the characters singing themselves.
* The dramatic opening, with Collins singing 'Two Worlds', sets the tone right away for drama and excitement. Tarzan's shipwrecked parents arrive in the jungle and build their treehouse; Kerchak and Kala lose their baby to a leopard attack; Kala discovers the orphaned Tarzan and saves him from another leopard (or maybe the same one). It feels epic right off the bat.
* Young Tarzan has a hard time fitting in with the gorillas, but the 'Son of Man' (an invigorating and inspiring song) sequence shows him overcoming his weaknesses by embracing that which makes him different. Using his human ingenuity, he crafts tools like spears and lassos, and uses tricks to conquer his environment. This theme culminates with adult Tarzan's fight against the leopard. By saving Kerchak and slaying the leopard with the tip of a spear, he proves he's become a master of the jungle.
* Tarzan saving Jane from the angered baboons is a thrilling action sequence, followed immediately by his proper introduction to Jane and his meaningful realization that she's the same as he is. When young Tarzan compared his hands to Kala's hands earlier, he saw that they were similar, yet not alike. Now he touches his hand to Jane's, and he realizes, with awe, that creatures like him do exist.
* 'Strangers Like Me' is another great song set to a montage, this time of Tarzan learning about the human world. This and 'Son of Man' are both on my regular playlist.
* The scene where Kala shows Tarzan the treehouse where she found him is an emotional moment and handled well; essentially like a mother revealing to her child that he was adopted. Tarzan ultimately makes the choice to put on his father's old suit and go back to England with Jane.
* The climax - saving the gorillas from Clayton and his men - is exciting and action-packed, and Clayton gets the comeuppance he deserves. Tarzan and Kerchak finally have their moment, and Tarzan realizes he has to stay; not because he wouldn't be able to adjust to life in England, but because he must take his place as the new leader of the troop. Jane, of course, decides to stay with him. Two worlds, one family.

**In Conclusion**

The vaunted Disney Renaissance draws to a close with *Tarzan*, but what a film to go out on. With its visuals, music, and storytelling, I believe this just might be the definitive version of Tarzan, in the same way that so many other Disney adaptations have become the definitive versions of their own stories. A top-tier movie for sure.

"Your thoughts on ""Mulan"" (1998)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6muyr2e5wrbb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ac4e90c8207c57a4d29e67961ff1237391a4f28

**Overview**

Prior to 1998, few people outside of China had ever heard the name Mulan. In true Disney fashion, however, the filmmakers took what might have once been an esoteric Far Eastern legend and turned it into a globally popular story that stands as a pillar of the Disney Renaissance.

**Point by Point**

* As is to be expected from a Disney animated movie of this era, the visuals look great. Even though it's a noticeably different aesthetic from *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King* \- inspired by Chinese watercolor - *Mulan* still looks every bit as good as its contemporaries.
* Mulan is immediately likable, and follows well in the tradition of strong Disney heroines like Ariel, Belle, and Pocahontas. She's surrounded by an excellent supporting cast; her family and her friends in the army are well-rounded and sympathetic, and Mushu provides sharp, observational comic relief. Even the mute Cricket serves a purpose by giving Mushu someone to riff to and play off of.
* Shan Yu, the Hun leader, is a dark, intimidating villain, but, as far as Disney antagonists go, he's one of the weakest. He's not really fleshed out at all, and, beyond being the guy who wants to kill the Emperor for some arbitrary reason, he isn't given much of a personality. To this day most people can't even recall the character's name. (I had to look it up.) But that's okay, because Shan Yu doesn't present the story's true obstacle. The real conflict of *Mulan* is the heroine's journey of self-discovery and determination, and her triumph in the face of adversity. That's the main point of all this here. Shan Yu presents merely a sinister monolith to be overcome once Mulan has come into herself.
* 'Reflection' is a good character song, giving us insight into Mulan's inner turmoil. The scene soon afterwards, where Mulan's father is given his conscription orders, is a dramatic one. He and the rest of the family all know it's his death warrant, and Mulan is keenly aware that things would be different if her parents had had a son instead. The sequence in which Mulan cuts her hair, takes her father's armor, and rides off into the night is done exceedingly well.
* 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' is a great song for a training montage. Notably, Mulan is given a way out here. After continuous failure, Captain Shang tells her to pack up and go home; but she doesn't. Instead she climbs up the pole and gets that arrow. As she admits later on, she's doing this for her father, but not *just* for her father.
* 'A Girl Worth Fighting For' is a cheery, upbeat number to cover the time spent marching, though it ends abruptly mid-sentence when the troops come upon the burned village and the remains of the Imperial Army. The subsequent battle on the mountain pass, culminating with the avalanche that wipes out most of the Huns, is one of the most impressive and exciting set pieces in any Disney animated film, and the climax in the Imperial City is nearly as good.

**In Conclusion**

A dramatic, exciting, and relatable story from beginning to end, with likable characters and good music. Definitely top-tier stuff.

**Overview**

*Hercules* came along at exactly the right time for me. I had just finished sixth grade, and we had covered a whole unit on Greek mythology that year, so I was into it. As might be expected, Disney's take on the legend is unique in a way that might displease purists and anthropologists, but it's still a fun movie (and, beat for beat, it's remarkably similar to 1978's *Superman*).

**Point by Point**

* Olympus and the Underworld both look amazing; probably the two best settings in the movie. Disney had to soften both Zeus and Hera considerably in order to make them likable. Hera in particular is...*pink*. Just...really, really *pink*. For that matter, the Hades of Greek myth was largely inoffensive. He tended to just stay in the Underworld and mind his own business. (Zeus, ironically, was much worse.) Disney's Hades, on the other hand, is more in line with the common cultural perception of Satan; a fire-based prince of darkness who deals in souls. James Woods does a masterful job of bringing some snark and some sleaze to the character.
* Hercules as the earnest, wide-eyed dope and Megara as the cynical woman who's been burned before creates a good dynamic that's deliberately reminiscent of the relationships between the leads of many a film from the ""screwball comedy"" genre of the 1930s. It's a good way to mix things up, especially since Megara starts out allied with Hades. Her song 'I Won't Say (I'm in Love)' is perfect for her.
* The movie starts out a bit slow. I'd say the first really good scene is Hercules' rescue of Megara from the centaur. His battle against the computer animated Hydra soon after looks fantastic. The best part of the movie comes in the third act, with Hades' war on Olympus and Hercules' rescue of Megara's soul from the Underworld.

**In Conclusion**

For a Disney Renaissance movie, *Hercules* is a bit toothless; a bit insubstantial. After the more dramatic *Pocahontas* and *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, I think it relies too much on jokes and gags. It has its moments, and I like Megara, but the story is mostly fluff, and none of the songs are stand-outs.

"Your thoughts on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

How did Disney ever manage to make a children's movie out of *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*? Well, the answer is, they changed virtually everything about the story and the characters. Even having done that, however, they still came out with the darkest, moodiest, most dramatic movie in the WDAS canon. *Hunchback* is short on comedy and whimsy, and long on themes of lust, damnation, and genocide, and some of it is bound to sail over the heads of most children. Despite its almost complete departure from its source novel, it's a great movie with a great story.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and music are striking and impressive right away, from the first shot of Notre Dame cathedral peeking through the clouds, and the first chords of the epic opening song 'The Bells of Notre Dame'. Quasimodo's backstory really sets the tone for the rest of the movie; within the first five minutes we see Frollo murder a woman and attempt to drown her baby in a well. (It ain't *The Aristocats*, that's for sure.)
* As the song says, Frollo ""saw corruption everywhere, except within."" He's a hypocrite of the highest order; as pious as he is hateful; the kind of man who has read the Bible from cover to cover without truly comprehending a word of it. He's a liar, a sadist, and a murderer, and he *revels* in it. Yet, when it comes to the matter of sin, he looks only outward at everyone around him. At least villains like Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar are true to themselves and their ideologies, but Frollo is torturing and murdering people while holding himself to be an arbiter of justice and godliness. Sadly, there have always been people like that in this world.
* Quasimodo is characterized well. In the novel he's deaf, and kind of a simpleton, but Disney retools him here to make him a more functional, more relatable protagonist (and also more central to the narrative). The way he swings and leaps agilely around the outside of the cathedral, across the towers, gutters, and parapets, is very well conceived and animated. In this way, he's not a prisoner; the entire cathedral is his playground.
* *Hunchback* is extremely light on humor, with the trio of gargoyles providing the only substantial comedy relief. I think their presence is necessary, if only so Quasimodo can have someone to talk to. Years of isolation and Frollo's emotional abuse have really taken their toll, and having Quasimodo just completely alone would be way too gloomy.
* The Festival of Fools is a fun, colorful sequence (where Esmeralda performs as sexually charged a dance as Disney could likely get away with); that is, until the crowd turns on Quasimodo and begins to humiliate and abuse him in a scene that's genuinely difficult to watch.
* 'God Help the Outcasts' is a beautiful song, and the lavish interior shots of the cathedral are breathtaking. In fact, everything in this movie looks spectacular. It just might be the best-looking Disney animated film done in the traditional style.
* Phoebus is the handsome jock to Quasimodo's shy nerd; he's the traditional hero type with whom Esmeralda falls in love. Given this, it would have been easy for Disney to portray him as an arrogant jerk who ultimately turns out to be a villain (especially since this is kind of how he is in the novel), clearing the way for Quasimodo to emerge as the rightful heir to Esmeralda's affections. But Phoebus is actually a good guy. As much as Quasimodo deserves love, I think it speaks well of the filmmakers that they didn't contrive to couple him up with the female lead in the end.
* 'Hellfire', of course, is a highlight of the film, and one of the best songs in the WDAS canon. It's powerful, intense, and woven perfectly into the narrative. And it's not even a song for the kids, because it's all about Frollo's panic over his lust for a woman and his frenzy to root it out.
* The movie only picks up from here, with Frollo's mad crusade to find Esmeralda eventually consuming all of Paris. The sequence at the Court of Miracles, and then the climactic siege of Notre Dame after Quasimodo's dramatic, visually stunning rescue of Esmeralda from the pyre. It's all a fantastic set piece that ends up extremely satisfying, to a soaring reprise of 'The Bells of Notre Dame'.

**In Conclusion**

One of the best Disney movies yet, if not *the* best. Gorgeous visuals and music, great characters, and deeper than usual themes all combine to deliver us a uniquely excellent film. Disney had never made something like this before, and probably never will again.

**Tier Ranking**

By the way, now that I've gotten through thirty-four Disney movies, I think I've gained enough of a frame of reference to begin ranking these by tier, which will be easier and ultimately more meaningful than ranking by number. (Within the tiers, they're listed in order of release.)

Subtitles Inclusivity,"Walt Disney Studios is one of the top five major film studios and controls more money than I can imagine, yet Disney+ has such a limited range of subtitle languages, some shows even lack them entirely. For a studio with such a global reach this seems ridiculous? 

  
The range of dubbed languages is much larger, but will not include all the languages of Disney's audience- it's so much quicker and cheaper to just add subtitles so could cover an even larger range of languages and would be accessible to those with hearing loss.   
I am learning French, and have had no luck finding any French subtitles on Disney+. In desperation I went to Miraculous Ladybug, an actual French show, that still had no French subtitles (although this might be a blessing in disguise for my sanity)

  
I understand that the service has launched relatively recently in comparison to some others, but this still seems unacceptable, especially with recent advances in auto-translate technologies. It may be an issue specifically with my region, but there are obviously still people in my region who speak languages other than English. Maybe there's no financial gain and the big decision-makers would rather put money into projects with more profit, but I think such a massive company has a moral obligation to be as inclusive as possible.

"Your thoughts on ""Pocahontas"" (1995)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

*Pocahontas* isn't historically accurate, let's get that out of the way right now. It's not an account of something that really happened. It's a fairy tale, starring fictional characters who just happen to be named after people who lived four hundred years ago. But that can be said of a lot of great movies purported to be based on historical people and events; movies like *Braveheart*, *Gladiator*, and *The Sound of Music*. So, let's not judge *Pocahontas* too harshly on that score; it still accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is tell a good story, sing a few songs, and teach the kiddies a lesson about tolerance.

**Point by Point**

* The movie opens with John Smith, Governor Ratcliffe, and the other settlers boarding their ship to leave England, then dealing with a squall at sea, during which Smith saves a young sailor named Thomas from drowning. After that bit of excitement, we transition to the Native Americans singing and harvesting. It seems peaceful and idyllic, but Chief Powhatan and the other men have just returned from a war with a rival nation. It's an acknowledgement that violence and conflict existed in the New World long before the white man showed up.
* The visuals and scenery are beautiful; definitely the best-looking forest landscapes since *Bambi*.
* Pocahontas is beautiful, graceful, and free-spirited. The first thing we see her do is dive off a high cliff into the water below. She's well animated, and the way she moves is unique. She's not just Belle in a buckskin. When she runs she takes huge strides and pounds the earth with her feet, arms pumping at her sides. And when she's spying on John Smith, she creeps along the ground and over rocks like someone accustomed to moving stealthily through the forest.
* I'd say that *Pocahontas* is easily the most serious Disney animated film yet (though it is surpassed in this by its immediate successor, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*). There's a lot of drama and talking, and not very much comedy, although Meeko, Flit, and Percy provide some occasional slapstick. Personally, as an adult viewer, I'm fine with that. During this marathon through the movies, I'm finding I have a greater appreciation for the drama and less of a desire to see it interrupted by excessive comedy.
* The initial meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith, and the first skirmish between the settlers and the Indians, are both good sequences, as is the colorful, invigorating montage set to 'Colors of the Wind'. 'Mine, Mine, Mine' is a rousing number as well.
* Judging by the conversation Ratcliffe has with his servant, Wiggins, he's not exactly in favor with King James at this time. He's greedy, for sure, but he's not looking for gold just so he can buy nice things; he needs that gold in order to buy back his reputation at court. That's why he's so desperately ready to believe that the Indians are hiding the gold from him; because the only alternative is that there is no gold, and if there's no gold, he's finished.
* Tensions have been building between the two camps, and they come to a head when Thomas ends up shooting the warrior (and Pocahontas' potential suitor) Kocoum in defense of John Smith. The climactic song 'Savages' really drives home the hatred that each side feels for the other, with both the settlers and the Indians regarding each other as ""barely even human"". It's not subtle, but, hey, it's a kids' movie.
* The moment when Pocahontas stops a war by saving John Smith from her father's wrath is a good one, and, just in case you thought the drama was over, Smith ends up taking a bullet for Powhatan immediately afterwards. Smith has to be taken back to England to heal (and Ratcliffe has to be taken back to face justice), but Pocahontas chooses to stay at home. Notably, *Pocahontas* is the first instance in the WDAS canon of the primary romance splitting up at the end. The two leads do not live happily ever after together. Kudos to Disney for not sticking Pocahontas on that ship.

**In Conclusion**

It may not be peak Disney, but *Pocahontas* is a good, low-key adventure with drama, romance, some good songs, a constructive social lesson, and visuals that, in their own way, look as good as those in *The Lion King*. I enjoyed it.

**Overview**

What is there to say about *The Lion King* that hasn't already been said? It's peak Disney, and very few films in the WDAS canon have achieved its prestige and legacy. It was the highest grossing film of its release year, it has become a multimedia franchise unto itself, and it is still regarded today as one of the best animated films ever.

**Point by Point**

* The opening hits hard and fast, with that burning sun and the soaring opening chords of 'Circle of Life'. That's literally the first thing your senses get as the movie begins. No ""Walt Disney Presents"". No storybook opening. Just ""BAAAAAAAAAA BAKWANZAAAAAAA!!!"" (And yes, I know those aren't the lyrics, but I don't speak Zulu, so that's what I'm hearing.) *The Lion King* really is the best-looking Disney animated feature so far, and this opening sequence exemplifies that with its colors, lighting, and animation. The animals, too, look better than ever. Baby Simba's presentation ceremony is invigorating, and really sets the tone.
* Scar, of course, is a great villain; clever, conniving, intimidating, and, at his core, extremely petty. He longs to be king, but only because he believes, myopically, that it will make him happy and fulfilled; only because he wants to be ""respected, saluted, and seen for the wonder I am"". He has no interest in actually being in charge; in being responsible for the well-being of the pride. When he does finally achieve his ambition, he just sits around while everything goes to hell. He's king, and he does nothing with it. As Mufasa points out to Simba, ""There's more to being king than getting your way all the time.""
* Most Disney animated films have one or two signature songs that really stand out and become inextricably linked with the film's identity. *Dumbo* has 'When I See an Elephant Fly'; *The Little Mermaid* has 'Part of Your World' and 'Under the Sea'; *Frozen* has 'Let It Go'. In *The Lion King*'s case, however, I think all of the songs loom equally large in our cultural consciousness, whether it's the fun, colorful, and raucous 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King', the moody villain song 'Be Prepared', the joyful and catchy 'Hakuna Matata', or the romantic ballad 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight'. Any of these songs (along with, of course, the aforementioned 'Circle of Life') is liable to pop into your head when you think of *The Lion King*.
* Likewise, it's amazing how Disney's visuals and animation have taken yet another quantum leap forward. We've just had *Beauty and the Beast* and *Aladdin*, yet *The Lion King* manages to look even better. The animals themselves are designed exquisitely, and every setting - from the sprawling, sun-baked Savannah, to the eerie elephant graveyard, to Timon and Pumbaa's idyllic oasis - is breathtaking. The stampede is an incredible set piece, immersive and overwhelming.
* I knew that *The Lion King* took some light inspiration from *Hamlet*, but, in doing my due diligence for this entry in the Disney canon, I learned that the Biblical story of Moses was also considered. I didn't see much similarity at first, apart from Moses exiling himself in the wilderness for years, but, under closer scrutiny, Rafiki's appearance to Simba and his exhortation to him to return could be a parallel to Moses' ""burning bush"" moment.
* The third act is full of good moments, whether it's the dramatic appearance of Mufasa's admonishing spirit, or the abrupt and absurd hula number performed by Timon and Pumbaa amidst the incongruous menace and gloom. The final clash between Simba and Scar is properly epic, and Scar's comeuppance is extremely satisfying. A cleansing rain follows, Simba assumes the throne, and, as we see in the film's final frames, the circle of life continues.

**In Conclusion**

With tremendous visuals and music, a great story, and top-notch performances by an all-star cast, *The Lion King* takes the throne. I did wrestle a bit, as I feel like I enjoyed *Beauty and the Beast* and *The Little Mermaid* just a bit more (I seem to be partial to the princess movies for some reason), but I just can't justify ranking *The Lion King* lower, so, to the top it goes. Eventually, when all's said and done, I'm going to have to break this list into tiers for a more accurate picture of my ranking.

Methods to get the best ultrawide viewing experience,"EDIT UP TOP: The Ultrawidify extension started working a day later (after a restart I suppose) and now I can view full screen on Microsoft Edge and the quality is pretty good.  


  
Hi all, lovely community!As others have posted, I'm trying to watch Disney + on my Ultrawide 4k monitor. The black bars are such a waste of *space* when watching shows like Mando and the newest Secret Invasion.

I've gotten some luck with the **Disney Plus Ultrawide Fullscreen Support** extension for Chrome, but Chrome's quality is lacking in streaming picture quality.

I've got an M1 Mac and a Dell PC and tried all different browsers and the official Disney + Windows app, but nothing else seems to work. Ultrawidify, another extension that has been recommended, didn't work on either machine.

Am I stuck with Chrome and bad picture quality but full-widescreen viewing with the extension, or does someone else have a suggestion I could try?

Thanks in advance!

"Your thoughts on ""Aladdin"" (1992)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9dclbslhp9b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e637cb5a4674a7e05835c95bb38964405fe7d63

**Overview**

Over the decades Disney had delivered us several fairy tales set in medieval Europe, a few in Victorian England, and even one or two in the urban United States, but *Aladdin* marked the first story set in exotic and unfamiliar Arabia. A favorite of the Disney Renaissance, *Aladdin* is a dazzling and adventurous tale, distinguished by its greater than usual emphasis on comedy, thanks largely to the performance by the late, great Robin Williams, who was allowed to improvise much of his dialogue.

**Point by Point**

* The opening is sweeping and majestic, set to the bombastic tune of 'Arabian Nights', and establishes the setting right away as one with which we're less familiar. The visuals, in general, are exquisitely colorful, and both characters and backgrounds look as if they could have been lifted from a storybook. The Cave of Wonders - both outside and inside - and the ""ends of the Earth"", with its driving blizzard, are both particular stand-outs.
* Like *Beauty and the Beast*'s 'Belle', the opening song 'One Jump Ahead' is an excellent character anthem that makes us immediately familiar with the main protagonist, his world, and his plight. After getting to know Aladdin as we watch him go to great lengths to escape the palace guards with a stolen loaf of bread, we see him hesitate only a moment before handing his hard-won bread over to a pair of starving orphan children. Moments later, he throws himself into harm's way to protect those same children from the cruel whip of a visiting prince. Abu is a good sidekick, providing mischief and comic relief.
* Jafar is an excellent villain; dark, slimy, conniving, and mostly competent. Maleficent and Ursula are still my favorites, but I'm not talking down Jafar. He's definitely one of Disney's strongest antagonists.
* The Genie, of course, grabs the movie with both hands and runs away with it the first moment he appears. He definitely pulls focus throughout the rest of the show, but his magical nature and the spirit of Robin Williams make him a natural star. He allows for a lot of comedy and spectacle, both of which inform the terrific songs 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali'.
* 'A Whole New World' is the midway showstopper we've come to expect from this era of Disney movies. Not only is it a great song (it won an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe), but the visuals of the Magic Carpet ride through the night and across multiple countries are gorgeous.
* Jafar seizing control of the Genie and banishing Aladdin might present the most daunting ""all is lost"" moment we've seen yet in a Disney animated movie. That's what makes Aladdin's storming of the palace and his confrontation with Jafar so exciting, and Jafar's comeuppance so satisfying. (I like that Jafar's ideal look for the captive Jasmine is basically Peggy Bundy from *Married...With Children*. You know, with the trashy clothes and the big hair. I guess that's just what gets Jafar's engine running.)
* It seems like it was a little too easy for the Sultan to change the law about Jasmine needing to marry a prince. He can just do that, unilaterally and arbitrarily? And if he could have done that all along, then *why didn't he?*

**In Conclusion**

With its excellent visuals and music and fun story, *Aladdin* is definitely a masterpiece, there's no doubt about that. Having said that, however, I didn't connect with the characters and their struggles quite as effectively as I did with those in my favorites, nor was I as awed by it as I was those other films. And I'm sure I'm asking for trouble here, but I found Robin Williams' routines to be a little bit much at times. (Like the merchant bit at the beginning was a bit cringe. And what was the point of the Jack Nicholson impression?) I know this is going to be unpopular, but, while it still gets a position of honor, I can't place it right at the top.

**Overview**

Okay, after a brief diversion with *The Rescuers Down Under*, we're back in the bloom of the Disney Renaissance; back on Broadway! Disney puts their own, unique spin on another beloved fairy tale, and boy, does it pay off. Utilizing new animation technology and new methods for their songwriting, Walt Disney Animation Studios gave us what is still considered to this day to be one of their best films. It was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture the following year. No disrespect to *The Silence of the Lambs*, but *Beauty and the Beast* deserved that award.

**Point by Point**

* *Beauty and the Beast* is exquisite from the outset. The stained glass windows are an excellent way of summing up the Beast's backstory, and a creative departure from the traditional storybook intro. The lavish artistry on display here really sets the tone for the masterpiece that's to come.
* The visuals and animation are better than in any Disney movie seen so far, surpassing even *The Little Mermaid*. The music, too, is tremendous. The opening number, 'Belle', is a great character song, effectively introducing us to the heroine. And, in the same song, we meet Gaston, who serves as an excellent subversion of the Prince Charming trope. Under normal circumstances he'd be the hero of the story, but he's not just handsome and strong; he's also arrogant, selfish, and cruel.
* Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts (as well as the rest of the castle servants) are good additions to the cast. You can't have just the Beast, after all; too lonely and dour. Lumiere and Cogsworth, in particular, share an effective dynamic.
* Upon our first proper look at the Beast, when he's menacing Maurice, he's quite fearsome and intimidating; hulking and savage. And he's not misunderstood or maligned, either. At this point in the story, the Beast is awful; he's petty, vindictive, and uncaring. Remember the act of callousness that got him into this mess in the first place? Well, he just repeated it with Maurice, denying the old man shelter for the night. Over the long years cooped up in his castle he's learned nothing.
* The lavish musical numbers of *Beauty and the Beast* really do drive home how far we've come since 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat'. The song 'Gaston' is a rousing crowd-pleaser, and 'Be Our Guest' is probably the most spectacular number in a Disney movie up to this point.
* Belle's panicked flight from the castle, out into the snow, and the Beast rescuing her from a pack of wolves is an exciting sequence. And, somehow, her leaving later to find her father (with the Beast's blessing) is just as dramatic.
* The ballroom scene; the visuals, the animation, and Angela Lansbury's stirring rendition of the title song. (Reportedly, she performed it perfectly on her first try, and everyone in the studio was weeping.) *Nothing* that Disney had done up to this point is better than this.
* 'The Mob Song' is the perfect number to suit the ever more villainous Gaston, and leads directly into one of the best action climaxes yet, particularly the rooftop duel between Gaston and the Beast. And the transformation of the Beast, the servants, and the castle itself is breathtaking.

**In Conclusion**

I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. *Beauty and the Beast* is the best WDAS movie so far, and one of the best in general. What more is there to say?

**Overview**

Circa the mid-1980s, *The Rescuers* had become one of Disney's most successful animated films. Thus it became the first WDAS movie to receive a sequel. With no songs, and with a greater emphasis on action, *The Rescuers Down Under* attempts to be more of an adventure movie. It pleased critics, but underperformed at the box office, thanks in large part to sharing its release date with the smash hit *Home Alone*.

**Point by Point**

* Whereas Bernard and Bianca were rarely offscreen in the original *The Rescuers*, this film focuses a good deal on just the child, Cody. In the first few minutes we see him free soloing a huge, sheer cliff, like Ethan Hunt at the start of *Mission: Impossible 2*, then soaring high above the clouds on the back of Marahute, the great golden eagle. (Obviously not the same animal as the real-life [golden eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle), which is considerably smaller, not endangered, and not found in Australia.)
* McLeach is a decent villain; not one of the all-time greats, but well-suited to this particular story. He's slimy, bad-tempered, and intimidating. I feel bad for his pet lizard, Joanna. McLeach is repeatedly abusive to her, always kicking her in the stomach or threatening to shoot her. It drives home how heartless and cruel he is.
* The difference in art styles between this movie and its predecessor are apparent right away. *The Rescuers* looks like a 1970s Disney movie, and *The Rescuers Down Under* looks like a 1990s Disney movie. It's got some good-looking scenes, including the mouse restaurant on top of the chandelier, and practically every moment that takes place in the Outback.
* John Candy's Wilbur is a good substitute for Orville (whose voice actor, Jim Jordan, had passed away). Speaking of Wilbur, does anyone else think his scenes at the mouse clinic seem a little...out of place? The mouse doctor is crazy and sadistic, and he and his nurses torture Wilbur, and menace him with a chainsaw. And we're supposed to...laugh, I guess? I dunno, it just strikes me as cruel and unpleasant, and it doesn't do anything to benefit the story.
* The scene with Cody locked up with McLeach's captured animals seems like it's just there to kill time. It doesn't serve the plot in any way. You could cut it out completely and the movie would remain unaffected. The climax at Crocodile Falls, where McLeach attempts to feed Cody to the crocs, is sufficiently exciting and moody, and McLeach gets a satisfying comeuppance.

**In Conclusion**

More of a brief diversion from the Disney Renaissance than an actual part of it, *The Rescuers Down Under* is honestly rather bland, and feels lacking in the same spirit and heart that made the original a standout of a mediocre era.

"Your thoughts on ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/04yhton70k8b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f61b9464aa0281786e426c9d76b7a0914be6e1b

**Overview**

The start of the Disney Renaissance! *The Little Mermaid* has more effort and more budget put into it than any WDAS movie in decades, and it shows. Not only has the animation and storytelling taken a quantum leap forward, but I think this is the first WDAS movie that could really, properly be described as a musical. The songs in prior Disney features are mostly incidental, or are meant to provide atmosphere, but *The Little Mermaid* is like a Broadway show; its songs are very much woven into the DNA of the narrative. This new formula and new devotion to the art form would pave the way for a prestigious run of films throughout the 1990s, the likes of which Disney had not seen before and has not seen since.

**Point by Point**

* Right away, the underwater environments and the colorful flora and fauna are impressive. Ariel is cute, feisty, and instantly likable. Her fiery red hair is iconic, but I think her most striking feature is her huge, expressive eyes (yes, her eyes). Like Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora before her, she wins the viewer's sympathy and love almost immediately. Flounder, Sebastian, and Scuttle all make good sidekicks.
* Ursula is easily the darkest, most intimidating villain since Cruella de Vil. With the slimy insidiousness of an octopus and the exaggerated manner of a drag performer, her presence is domineering and her personality unforgettable. I think she and Maleficent are my favorite Disney villains.
* The scene in Ariel's grotto full of human artifacts, where she sings 'Part of Your World', really demonstrates the quality of *The Little Mermaid*. The animation, the lighting, Ariel's expressiveness, and Jodi Benson's tremendous singing voice all contribute. This leads straight into Ariel's rescue of Prince Eric from the violent storm, which is one of the most dramatically exciting sequences we've seen in a Disney movie in some time, and that shot of her singing on the rock while she watches Eric on the beach and the surf crashes behind her is exquisite.
* The songs in this movie really soar. As I noted above, the Broadway influence really makes a difference. Prior Disney movies had numbers performed by choruses or jazz musicians, but *The Little Mermaid* is giving its all with material that Andrew Lloyd Webber would be proud of. The insanely bouncy and colorful 'Under the Sea' is a proper showstopper.
* After Triton's dramatic destruction of Ariel's collection, Ursula's two eels slither on in, like the serpent in Eden, and put a flea in Ariel's ear about seeking help from the sea witch. Ursula dwells inside the carcass of some long-dead behemoth, guarded by a menagerie of wretched creatures that used to be mermaids and mermen and were foolish enough to strike a bargain with her. We know that Triton exiled her from the palace some indeterminate amount of time prior, but we don't know why. Her song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' is a great villain anthem that starts out velvety and coaxing, then grows more boisterous and more insistent until Ursula is practically shouting at Ariel to accept her Faustian bargain. The tension climaxes with Ursula's occult chanting, and then Ariel's tail splitting into a pair of human legs as Flounder and Sebastian rush her to the surface.
* Ariel trying to adjust to surface life - combing her hair with a fork, etc. - is good for comedy, as is the sequence in the kitchen with Sebastian and Chef Louis.
* 'Kiss the Girl' is another great musical sequence; catchy, magical, with sparkling, moonlit scenery.
* The climax is spectacular and exciting, starting with Ariel crashing Eric and Ursula's wedding, getting her voice back, and freeing Eric of Ursula's enchantment. But the sun sets and Ariel changes back into a mermaid. Ursula grabs her and takes her back down into the sea, where she's intercepted by Triton. Seeing no other alternative, Triton consents to take Ariel's place in Ursula's ""garden"", and Ursula seizes his crown and trident. She grows immense, and uses her new power to summon a hurricane and raise wrecks from the deep. Fortunately, Eric is able to use one of these wrecks to impale her, and she dies in dramatic fashion.
* The finale is extremely satisfying, with Triton using his power to turn Ariel back into a human and blessing her marriage to Eric. All's well that ends well.

**In Conclusion**

Not only is *The Little Mermaid* the best Disney animated movie since *Sleeping Beauty*, but I think it actually surpasses it. It took three decades of lesser entries, but Walt Disney's 1959 masterpiece is finally toppled from its high throne.

My take of a Disney musical comedy episodic animated series aimed for the current younger demographic,"Well, now that Disney television animation will focus primarily on episodic musical comedy shows aimed for younger audience that will air on Disney + and Disney channel (Disney XD also but will soon be dead) while serialized ones which are aimed for older audience and mostly produced by Disney Europe Animation will air on Disney+ only.

I thought I will explain my pitch for a musical comedy episodic animated series that Disney can use and aim for young audience and well let’s just say it kinda rips off from the animated series from Canada called Grojband, so anyway here is my pitch

My take of a musical comedy episodic animated series will focus on some indie teen rock band who must come up with some songs and perform in front of a crowd and make it big while going on some crazy adventures, near the end of the episode, the band will perform the song inspired from their adventures and problems of the week and the B-plot involves their younger siblings who are also going on some crazy adventures like their elder siblings but different.

What inspired me to create this pitch? Well, seeing that the current trend of musical comedy episodic animated series made by Disney began with Phineas and Ferb that started with one of their iconic episodes Flop Starz attract viewers especially that Disney always make musicals a long time ago from the very beginning starting with Snow white and the seven dwarfs (1937) , I think I can deal with that era as the animated series will move on from the serialized era even though it will move on to Disney+ and be aimed for older audience.

But as the musical comedy episodic animated series focus on comedy in wacky situations, it couldn’t focus on the main thing and that’s music itself along with the musicians, so I thought this pitch of musical comedy episodic animated series if turned real if Disney accepts would focus on a Garage Rock Band performing songs and make a song based on their adventures like how Big time rush and Grojband did.

And that’s my take of a Disney musical comedy episodic animated series aimed for the current younger demographic.",0,0.5,0,trover2345325,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1687863555.0,False,False,False

Fixing the Pillarbox Effect for Shows on Disney+,"I've noticed that a lot of old TV shows on Disney+ in 4:3 aspect ratio (Doogie Howser, Ally McBeal, Family Guy, etc.) will be ""pillarboxed"" to 16:9. Essentially, black bars will be added to the right and left sides of the source video to force it into a 16:9 aspect ratio.

However, since these boxes are added to the *source* of the video, and not the *displayed* video, when you try watching one of these shows on a 4:3 monitor, it looks like a postage stamp.

[\\""postage stamp\\"" effect \(black bars all around the actual picture\)](https://preview.redd.it/thmmbbr2d78b1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=f412561af7e843e1abdf350a6a5e204e15d7c8cd)

This is a combination of the pillarbox forcing a 4:3 video into a 16:9 aspect ratio, and then being displayed on a 4:3 monitor. If Disney+ didn't force pillarboxing on these shows, this problem wouldn't exist.

For example, a lot of Disney Channel originals (Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, etc) are uploaded in their native 4:3 aspect ratio, and look fine on these displays.

As a big fan of retro TV, I love watching these old shows on 4:3 monitors, but getting ""postage stamped"" by Disney+ ruins it. It drove me so nuts that I built a Google Chrome extension to fix this problem.

Once the extension is enabled, it will remove the pillarboxing for old shows and display them correctly:

[postage stamp effect removed with the extension](https://preview.redd.it/87bl4ewpe78b1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2105f9f02624051e696ee9f3ec52f9fe431be96)

**It only does this on 4:3 monitors**, so if you're watching on a normal 16:9 monitor, your shows won't be affected. It also **won't apply this effect to shows that are already natively in 4:3**, like the Disney Channel original TV shows. However, if you're watching a show that's in 16:9, it'll scale it so that you don't get a letterbox effect on your 4:3 monitor (you can easily disable this effect through the plugin options menu).

I understand that this is an incredibly niche problem to have and solve, but I figured at least one other person would have this issue. The plugin is entirely [open source](https://github.com/nicholasc120/Disney-PillarUnboxing) and link to download is [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disney%2B-pillar-unboxing/fbclpdcoipildpbipaoddfoaijleaemm).

&#x200B;

edit: Another use case: I like watching TV on an old CRT and feed an input through from my PC, but the pillarboxing ruins it. Here's a before and after when using the extension on this type of display:

"Your thoughts on ""Oliver & Company"" (1988)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/8h3dbkxir78b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4fbb029926188f80176441c0e1791f0144ee4ea

**Overview**

Disney's loose interpretation of *Oliver Twist*, in which Oliver is a kitten, the street thieves are dogs, and Fagin is voiced by Dom DeLuise. The 1980s appeared to mark a time of uncertainty for Walt Disney Animation Studios. After the catastrophic failure of *The Black Cauldron*, and with stiff competition from Don Bluth, it seems to me that WDAS might have been struggling with their identity. Indeed, *Oliver & Company*, with its contemporary setting, its pop rock soundtrack, and its loan shark villain, is a marked departure from their usual fairy tale fare.

**Point by Point**

* The opening song 'Once Upon a Time in New York City' (performed by Huey Lewis) really serves to set the tone, helping to establish New York as this bittersweet, even ethereal place where dreams can come true, even as poor Oliver is dodging cars and stray dogs and being swept through the gutter by the torrential rain. The city presents a grittier, more urban backdrop than we're used to, complete with real brand names (Coca-Cola, Kodak, Ryder) on the signboards.
* Oliver is cute and likable, and his tenacity and determination are endearing. Even after a hellish night by himself on the street, and even as Dodger leads him on a daunting and perilous chase through Manhattan, he doesn't give up his rights to half of those hot dogs, and he tails Dodger all the way to Fagin's barge. Dodger's song 'Why Should I Worry?' (performed by Billy Joel, who also provides Dodger's speaking voice) is pretty catchy.
* Sykes is a suitably menacing villain; a loan shark/gangster who speaks with a throat full of gravel and is often enshrouded in shadows and cigar smoke. You really do believe that he might kill Fagin at any moment. His two Dobermans play the role of henchmen. Unlike the henchmen of so many other Disney villains, they are *not* there to provide comic relief.
* Fagin's dogs provide the usual cast of colorful characters. There's Tito the hot-headed Chihuahua, Francis the snobbish bulldog, Einstein the dim-witted Great Dane, and Rita, a Saluki who tries to serve as the voice of reason. They're all fine, if not particularly memorable.
* I'm not sure what the dogs are trying to do with the Foxworth family's limousine. Tito is hotwiring it...Are they trying to steal it? Are they trying to steal the limousine? Are these dogs going to drive a limousine back to Fagin's?
* Georgette (Bette Midler), for all her flaws, is actually fairly likable. She's a spoiled, prize-winning poodle who isn't at all happy to see Oliver join the Foxworth household, and who attempts to get rid of him at first opportunity. She redeems herself later on, however, and, like Tinker Bell in *Peter Pan*, it's just hard to hate her, even when she's being malicious. Her song, 'Perfect Isn't Easy', is a good number.
* Like a good dog, Dodger defends Fagin at the meeting with Sykes, sustaining a rough beating from the two Dobermans. The climactic chase scene, in which Sykes pursues the good guys in his car on the subway tracks, is exciting, if a bit silly. (How mad do you have to be to drive your car down the stairs, onto the tracks, and into the tunnel?) Both Dobermans fall onto the tracks and are electrocuted, and Sykes is annihilated by an onrushing train.

**In Conclusion**

*Oliver & Company* is a decent enough film, and it certainly has its strong points, but I'm afraid it's typical of Disney's animated efforts during this era; mediocre, unspectacular, ultimately forgettable. Over the course of the past thirty years, only a precious few WDAS films have really stood out from a pack of blandness. Good news, though; we've finally reached the Disney Renaissance, with *The Little Mermaid* up next! This is going to be fun!

**Overview**

Based on the Basil of Baker Street series of children's novels (which, in turn, were based on Sherlock Holmes), *The Great Mouse Detective* follows the adventures of Basil (named after famed Sherlock Holmes actor Basil Rathbone, of course), who lives in Holmes' basement and solves cases brought to him by the rodent community. It was successful both critically and commercially, and, in the wake of the disaster that was *The Black Cauldron*, it revitalized WDAS and very probably saved the studio.

**Point by Point**

* Basil is just as brilliant as Holmes at deductive reasoning, and also just as eccentric and socially awkward. It takes Dawson and Olivia time to get through to him, and he only really becomes interested in the case of Olivia's missing father when he realizes that he can link it to his nemesis, Professor Ratigan.
* 'The World's Greatest Criminal Mind' is a good instance of character development set to music; that's what songs in musicals really ought to be for. Basil has already talked Ratigan up as the Napoleon of crime, but now we get to know him firsthand. In particular we see that he is a rat with a sort of self-hatred complex, and insists that he is actually just a large mouse. When one of his men makes the mistake of referring to him as a rat, Ratigan feeds him to Felicia, his pet cat.
* *The Great Mouse Detective* isn't overly exciting, though it does have some good sequences, including the action scene in the toy shop, the investigation at the seedy tavern, and the escape from Ratigan's death trap. The climactic scene inside of Big Ben, set against a black void of clicking, grinding gears, is appropriately atmospheric. When Ratigan loses his temper he finally becomes a rat - all claws and teeth and hunched back - and the battle moves outside for an exciting finale on Big Ben's face.

**In Conclusion**

*The Great Mouse Detective* is okay. It's no masterpiece, and it's a little cheesy at times, but it has its charms, particularly for children and for fans of Sherlock Holmes. I wish I had more to say about it, but I think I've covered everything of note. Its greatest legacy is that it helped pave the way for the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s.

**Overview**

Of all the ranging and diverse movies turned out by Walt Disney Animation Studios over almost a century now, *The Black Cauldron* is probably the most obscure; the least beloved. Inspired loosely by *The Chronicles of Prydain*, a series of fantasy novels by Lloyd Alexander, it was possibly the studio's greatest misfire, and its expensive, spectacular failure actually cast doubt on the future of Disney animated films.

**Point by Point**

* Frankly, it's not difficult to see why *The Black Cauldron* failed to resonate with audiences. To start off, none of the characters are interesting or even particularly likable. Most of them are just generic cliches from the fantasy genre. There's the farm boy who wants to be a mighty warrior; there's a tagalong princess who isn't really good for anything; there's a comedy relief minstrel; and there's a weird, furry mascot who's strikingly similar to Gollum. And none of them are endowed with interesting personalities or histories. We don't learn what makes them tick. They don't deal with personal conflicts and grow into better people. They're just there because the story requires them to be there.
* And as for the story, it's astonishingly bland for a Disney movie. It's not as if the people at Disney didn't understand how to craft an effective narrative, yet it's boring and unengaging from beginning to end; no highs and lows to remark on, just one long, flat line of *blah*. There's a magic sword, but we're never told of its nature or its origin. There's supposed to be a romance brewing between the male protagonist and the princess, but their interactions are completely devoid of chemistry. The villain's goal is ill-defined (something about wanting to use the Cauldron to create an undead army), and, once achieved, is undone almost immediately. And Gurgi's self-sacrifice at the end fails to evoke any emotional response because, again, I don't care about *any* of these characters.
* And there aren't any songs either. Now, that's not innately a bad thing. WDAS has turned out some great films over the years that haven't been reliant on musical numbers, but the lack of music and whimsy here does the already lackluster *Black Cauldron* no favors.

**In Conclusion**

*The Black Cauldron* is such a dramatic departure from what you'd expect from a Disney animated movie. It simply doesn't have anything to recommend it, and it deserves its place in relative obscurity. It's easily the weakest film in the WDAS canon. I'd even rank it below the anthology films of the 1940s, because at least those made me smile.

**Overview**

Though it's not apparent from an aesthetic standpoint, *The Fox and the Hound* marked the end of an era at Disney. The core animators and creative talents who had been working diligently for Walt Disney since before *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* all retired on this project, necessitating an influx of new blood. Most of these had been trained in-house, but the generational gap led to significant creative disputes, which led in turn to production delays. Notably, Don Bluth (who had previously worked on *Robin Hood*, *The Rescuers*, and *Pete's Dragon*) resigned, took a bunch of other animators with him, and set up his own production company. Throughout the 1980s Bluth would produce and release *The Secret of NIMH*, *An American Tail*, *The Land Before Time*, and *All Dogs Go to Heaven*, all of which are regarded highly today.

**Point by Point**

* The opening of *The Fox and the Hound* is eerie and tense, with a hunted mother fox carrying her baby as she flees the hounds. She drops him at the farm owned by the Widow Tweed, and is killed almost immediately afterwards. Big Mama, a kind owl, arranges for the fox to be adopted by the Widow, who names him Tod. At just about the same time, her neighbor Amos Slade brings home Copper, a new bloodhound pup.
* Tod and Copper are both cute, and it's fun to watch them play. Of course, chaos ensues the first time Slade and his other dog, Chief, discover Tod on their property. (Slade isn't the villain of the story. He's kind of a dick, and he has an itchy trigger finger, but he's not evil.)
* After Slade and the dogs return from a months long hunting trip, Tod and Copper - both adults now - have a brief reunion, during which Copper expresses happiness at seeing Tod, but informs him that their erstwhile friendship can't continue. The scene abruptly turns to a chase when Chief notices Tod. Slade and the two dogs chase Tod into hiding; Copper corners him, but allows him to escape. Immediately after this, Chief chases Tod onto a railroad trestle and into the path of a train. The train strikes Chief, and Copper - angry at himself for having let Tod escape - vows revenge.
* Chief survives his run-in with the train, getting away with just a broken leg. This served as one of the aforementioned bones of contention between the older filmmakers (who balked at killing Chief off) and the younger (who maintained the conflict didn't make sense if Chief survived). Personally, I think the story would have been better served by Chief's death, but I get it. Children's entertainment is evolving all the time, and, in 1981, Disney simply wasn't ready to give us a Mufasa moment. They hadn't come quite that far yet.
* With Slade gunning for Tod, the Widow has no choice but to release him onto the nearby game preserve, where she imagines he'll be safe. It's sad, because she's saying goodbye to her beloved pet and companion, who she raised from a cub. Of course, Tod isn't used to living wild, and he has a rough first night of it. The next day, with Big Mama's help, he meets Vixey, a lovely female fox, and things begin to look brighter.
* Slade and Copper, in their wrath, are willing to trespass on the game preserve and poach Tod. After a chase, and some scuffling between Tod and Copper, a huge grizzly bear appears out of nowhere and attacks Slade and Copper. Slade, with his foot caught in one of his own traps and his gun out of reach, is defenseless, and Copper has the fight knocked out of him. Tod could be well and away with Vixey and leave his pursuers to their fate, but, because of what Copper once was to him, he goes back and attacks the bear on their behalf.
* The moment after the fight with the bear, when Copper steps in front of Tod to shield him from Slade...I don't believe that's simply a matter of ""Well, he saved our lives, so I'll save his"", although that's certainly part of it. Copper doesn't growl and snarl at his master; he isn't taking a rebellious, disloyal stand. He looks at Slade gently, imploringly, as if to say, ""Dad, we have to let this go. Tod hurt us, but killing him doesn't accomplish anything. We have to let go of this rage and this hatred, if only for our own sakes. This isn't us, Dad. Let's go home."" Judging by the softening and ultimately accepting expression on Slade's face, the message gets through.

**In Conclusion**

Following on from *The Rescuers*, *The Fox and the Hound* is another dark-ish Disney film, with some slightly heavier themes than those found in *One Hundred and One Dalmatians*, *The Sword in the Stone*, or *Robin Hood*. It's the kind of film your kids can learn from as they grow older. Though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, I'd say it holds up.

**Overview**

Taking light inspiration from a series of children's books by author Margery Sharp, *The Rescuers* is a fairly low-key, straightforward adventure film that just happens to star two talking mice. It received near universal acclaim from critics and was a box office success, and this would lead to a sequel being released thirteen years later.

**Point by Point**

* *The Rescuers* gets straight to the point. The very first thing we see onscreen is a little girl aboard a shadowy riverboat down on the bayou, tiptoeing past a couple of sinister-looking crocodiles and dropping a bottled plea for rescue into the water. The opening credits play over still paintings of the bottle being tossed over waves and through storms, while the moody song 'The Journey' plays, until it reaches New York City.
* Bernard and Bianca are both immediately likable protagonists, with personalities that compliment each other. Bernard is a worrywart, and Bianca tends to fly by the seat of her pants. This makes for a good ""odd couple"" dynamic between the two.
* While Bernard and Bianca are searching for clues at the orphanage from which Penny disappeared, we're treated to a flashback sequence that introduces us to Penny. She's a sad little girl who just wants to be adopted by some nice couple, and it's easy to sympathize right away with her. She's cute, but not obnoxiously so.
* At one point during the movie's development, there was the idea to have Cruella de Vil return and serve as the villain. This notion was ultimately scrapped, of course, but Madame Medusa is Cruella in all but name, from the trashy clothes to the bad temper to the horrific driving skills. And though she's a relatively obscure and unremarkable figure in Disney's pantheon of villains, Madame Medusa might be one of the studio's most despicable. Characters like Maleficent and Ursula are pure evil, of course, but they're just pretend. Nobody like them exists in real life. Medusa, on the other hand, is emblematic of a very real evil in this world; she's a cruel, ruthless person who will exploit and abuse a child to get what she wants. Sadly, there are children actually watching *The Rescuers* who have been victimized by Medusas of their own.
* *The Rescuers* definitely has the look of its time, but it stands out from other contemporary Disney releases with an overall darker, perhaps even muddier tone to its visuals, which fits its settings (New York City and the swamp) to a T. The backgrounds are particularly striking and colorful in an unconventional way. We hardly see any blue sky, for example. The scenes in New York are set against a smoggy sunset, and the sky above Devil's Bayou is a sulfuric yellow. It's very moody.
* *The Rescuers* has some amusing ideas in general; using an albatross as an airplane and a dragonfly as an outboard motor, and the sequence where the crocodiles ""play"" the pipe organ in order to get Bernard and Bianca out of the pipes.
* The sequence down in the pirates' cave is tense and suspenseful, and with an appropriate air of encroaching doom as the tide begins to surge in. We really do feel the urgency as Penny and the mice search for the large diamond, and then the triumph as they find it.
* The climax is action-packed, with various friendly swamp critters getting in on the act, attacking Medusa and setting off fireworks. The riverboat sinks, and the good guys get away on Medusa's ""swamp mobile"". Satisfyingly, Medusa's crocodiles turn on her.

**In Conclusion**

I'm inclined to agree with the reviewers of the time. *The Rescuers*, while not anything overly special, appears to be constructed with more artistry, originality, and heart than the past several Disney films, and is probably the best one since *Sleeping Beauty*. I enjoyed the characters and themes, and found the aesthetic choices in visual style and music enhanced the story.

"Your thoughts on ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (1977)","https://preview.redd.it/qcfdtvfbk86b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae311cb1c941df6db509579cf58ad80b26812375

**Overview**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is a compilation of three short Pooh features that had been produced and released by Disney in the preceding years; *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* (1966), *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* (1968), and *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* (1974). There's been a lot of Pooh-related media since, especially after the 1997 movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin* sparked his popularity. Today Pooh is a multimedia franchise unto himself, but it all started with these earnest adaptations.

**Point by Point**

* The Pooh features honor their literary origins with a unique storybook format that allows for whimsical visual gags, occasionally showing the characters interacting with the words on the page or speaking with the narrator. It wouldn't work with most other characters, but it seems to fit Pooh and his friends just right.
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* is pretty basic, serving as an introduction to Pooh and his world. We see him perform his ""stoutness exercises"" (which only enhance his appetite), cooperate with Christopher Robin to try and trick some bees out of their honey, and eat Rabbit out of house and home, only to get himself stuck in the front door when he tries to leave. There are some good bits there, like Rabbit trying to adapt Pooh's rear end to his home decor, and Gopher (an original Disney character) repeatedly saying, ""I'm not in the book, you know.""
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* is more dynamic, with more action. We see Piglet blown through the air like a kite with Pooh hanging on, we see Owl's tree blow over and crash to the ground, and we meet the boisterous, rambunctious Tigger. The dream Pooh has about Heffalumps and Woozles is bizarre, and calls to mind 'Pink Elephants on Parade' from *Dumbo*. Then, of course, there's the rainstorm that floods the Hundred Acre Wood.
* *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* is good as well, but I think it's the least eventful and the least colorful of the three segments. Most of the focus is on how annoyed Rabbit is with getting repeatedly assaulted by Tigger.

**In Conclusion**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is strictly kids' stuff (and, considering the source material, that's hardly a surprise), but its whimsy and gentle humor makes it an enjoyable diversion for adult fans as well. I found myself smiling and chuckling in all the right places. Generally speaking, Pooh isn't something you hold onto as you grow older, but it can still be fun to go back and visit.

just watched Crater,"I hope this is the right subreddit

so I watched crater and it was good and all but why did Caleb have to go into cryosleep for 75 years just to go from the moon to earth? going that distance would take around 4 days in a modern day spaceship so i don’t understand what took 75 years. i could just be missing something super obvious but it’s been bothering me ever since i watched it.",10,0.92,7,spacesnail_,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1686848195.0,False,False,False
